/**
 * P12Ch04 · Section 43 — "Cheat Sheet: Quick Recall for the Whole Chapter"
 * Canvas 1080×620 · safe x36–1044, y30..596.
 *
 * WHAT IT USED TO SHOW: a blind three-panel template gated on 0/1/7/11 of a
 * 12-beat narration — eight reveals unused, the board frozen through most of
 * the audio — and four drawn shapes in total (a title underline, two rules
 * and a badge circle). Nothing on it was a picture of anything.
 *
 * WHAT THE NARRATION TEACHES: the final-revision pass. Five subtopics, each
 * given as a short fact block immediately followed by its memory aids —
 * ① Biot–Savart (dB ⊥ the plane of I dl and r, the right-hand grip rule, arc
 * as a fraction of a loop / polygon as a sum of finite wires / a segment
 * aimed at the point giving nothing) → "add the swirls, not the numbers";
 * ② Ampère (only enclosed current, loop shape irrelevant, the thick-wire
 * profile, the solenoid, the toroid) → "true for any loop, solvable only for
 * the symmetric few" and "thread it or forget it"; ③ forces and torque (the
 * magnetic force does no work, the period holds no speed, torque maximum when
 * the plane contains B and zero when the plane is ⊥ to it) → "only steers,
 * never speeds", "like currents cuddle", "θ is to the NORMAL"; ④ the two
 * conversions and their ideal resistances → the A/V lettering aid and "shunt
 * is small, multiplier is mighty"; ⑤ the dipole (m = N I A along the normal,
 * the 2 : 1 ratio, both fields ∝ 1 ⁄ r³, the e ⁄ 2m factor of two) → "a baby
 * bar magnet", "moment to momentum is e ⁄ 2m", "axial beats equatorial".
 * It closes on the four habits for the exam hall.
 *
 * THE FIGURE: small inline glyphs beside the facts they belong to — a wire
 * wrapped in its field loop for the grip rule, a segment aimed at a field
 * point crossed out, the thick-wire B-versus-r profile that rises, peaks at
 * the surface and falls, an orbit with B into the page carrying v and an
 * inward force, a loop drawn edge-on with B in its plane (τ maximum) and a
 * second drawn edge-on with B along its normal (τ = 0), the dipole loop with
 * its moment, and a two-bar comparison of the axial and equatorial fields.
 *
 * ARITHMETIC ON THE BOARD (recomputed): the axial/equatorial bars are drawn
 * 48 px and 24 px tall — exactly the 2 : 1 the narration states. μ₀ is quoted
 * as 4π × 10⁻⁷ so that μ₀ ⁄ 4π = 10⁻⁷ exactly.
 *
 * BEAT MAP (n_reveals = 12 — gates 0..11, every beat used):
 *    0 title + underline + subtitle
 *    1 ① BIOT–SAVART facts  + grip glyph + the aimed-segment glyph
 *    2 aid: "add the swirls, not the numbers"
 *    3 ② AMPÈRE facts  + the B-versus-r profile glyph
 *    4 aids: "true for any loop…" and "thread it or forget it"
 *    5 ③ FORCES & TORQUE facts  + orbit glyph + the two torque orientations
 *    6 aids: only steers · like currents cuddle · θ to the NORMAL
 *    7 ④ THE CONVERSIONS facts + the two ideal resistances
 *    8 aids: A → low R, in series · V → very high R, in parallel · sizes
 *    9 ⑤ THE DIPOLE facts  + loop-and-moment glyph + the 2 : 1 bars
 *   10 aids: baby bar magnet · moment to momentum · axial beats equatorial
 *   11 the four habits for the exam hall, and the sign-off
 *
 * Layout: three full-height columns, fact block then aid block in each —
 *   col ① x44..368 (subtopics 1 & 2)
 *   col ② x384..712 (subtopics 3 & 4)
 *   col ③ x728..1044 (subtopic 5, then the exam-hall habits).
