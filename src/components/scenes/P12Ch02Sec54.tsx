/**
 * P12Ch02 · Section 54 — "Reconnecting charged capacitors — energy always leaks away"
 * Subtopic: Series & Parallel Combinations & Charge Sharing
 *
 * THREE DEFECTS FIXED (2026-08-21):
 *
 * 1. THE BOARD TAUGHT A DIFFERENT TOPIC FROM THE VOICE. The scene was built
 *    for an older section on the Van de Graaff generator — belt, dome, spray
 *    comb, ΔV = (q/4πε₀)(1/r − 1/R), a 10⁷ V breakdown limit and SF₆ at 15 atm.
 *    None of that appears anywhere in this chapter's narration any more; the
 *    voice at position 54 talks about joining two already-charged capacitors,
 *    charge conservation, and the energy that is always lost. Narration is
 *    authoritative, so every quantity on the board has been replaced with the
 *    ones the voice actually uses: V_com, q₁ + q₂, and
 *    ΔU = ½[C₁C₂/(C₁+C₂)](V₁ − V₂)². The unused belt-animation term
 *    (`currentTime * 40 % 80`) went with it.
 *
 * 2. A WHOLE BLOCK NEVER RENDERED. The applications badge, its heading, its
 *    two lines and the footer chip were gated on `beat >= 7`, but this section
 *    has 7 narration segments so useBeat only ever returns 0..6.
 *
 * 3. DEAD AIR. The old gate set was {0,1,3,4,6,7}: beats 2 and 5 drew nothing.
 *
 * Beats now map 1:1 onto the seven segments
 * (board_reveal_at_english [0, 4.61, 9.22, 16.59, 23.35, 32.87, 43.32]):
 *
 *   0  "a third situation worth flagging"          title
 *   1  "two charged capacitors at different        the two-capacitor diagram
 *       potentials, joined together"
 *   2  "charge sloshes across until both settle    the flow arrow + V_com
 *       at one common potential"
 *   3  "total charge is conserved"                 the conservation line
 *   4  "total energy is NOT conserved — lost as    ΔU, heat and radiation
 *       heat in the wires and a little radiation"
 *   5  "the loss is unavoidable; it vanishes only  (V₁−V₂)² ≥ 0 verdict
 *       when both already sit at the same V"
 *   6  "assume like plate to like plate"           the stated assumption + chip
