 * M11 Ch09 · Section 39 — "Intersection and family: formula toolkit"
 * Canvas 1080×620 · safe x36–1044, y30–596. Spec: SCENE_AUTHORING.md + SCENE_AUTHORING_MATHS.md.
 * section_type: formulas — reference-toolkit recap of intersection/parallel/coincident tests,
 * the concurrency determinant, and the family-of-lines trick. Same "formula_recap / cheat_sheet"
 * discipline as this chapter's four finished sibling toolkit sections (M11Ch09Sec5, Sec13, Sec22,
 * Sec30 — the direct layout precedent): one formula per beat, HIGH-emphasis items boxed (Chip for
 * plain formulas), normal-emphasis items as plain bold ink text, the closing red-margin note as
 * the Sec1/Sec5/Sec13/Sec22/Sec30-style red bar + red text. M11Ch09Sec38 (the preceding proof
 * section, which also needed a determinant) was still its unbuilt placeholder at authoring time,
 * so the determinant grid below is built fresh from first principles (Draw bar strokes + a 3×3
 * grid of <T> calls), per the task's explicit fallback instruction — no math-kit primitive exists
 * for a literal determinant and none is added here (single-occurrence-per-chapter primitives are
 * house policy against, per SCENE_AUTHORING_MATHS's \underbrace/\begin{cases} precedent).
 *
 * board_content seq1 is the heading ("Intersection & Family — Toolkit") -> always-on title.
 * seq2..seq8 (7 items) gate at beat>=1..beat>=7. reveals_english (8 values) = [0.0, 5.55, 24.23,
 * 32.09, 38.06, 44.97, 51.29, 58.28]; reveals_hinglish (8 values) = [0.0, 6.23, 22.61, 30.21,
 * 34.99, 40.87, 46.93, 53.33].
 *
 * Emphasis from JSON: seq2 (Cramer x/y) normal, seq3 (parallel) normal, seq4 (intersecting)
 * normal, seq5 (coincident) normal, seq6 (concurrency determinant) HIGH, seq7 (family L1+λL2=0)
 * HIGH, seq8 (guardrail: concurrency assumes no two of three lines parallel) HIGH + red-margin.
 * Three normal formulas -> plain bold ink T; family -> Chip (CREAM/AMBER/AMBER_DARK, matching
 * Sec5/13/22/30's HIGH convention); guardrail -> red bar + red text. The concurrency determinant
 * is this section's ONE genuinely-2-D item — see DETERMINANT GRID section below for how it gets
 * its HIGH "boxed" treatment without a literal Chip rect.
 *
 * DETERMINANT GRID — 2-D footprint vs. the single-centered-column precedent (per task's explicit
 * request to document this reasoning): Sec5/13/22/30 all fit as ONE centered text/Chip column
 * because every row is a single text line ~20-45px tall with 28-30px of clearance to spare above
 * the 24px floor, leaving 45-90px of unused margin at the foot of the board. This section has 8
 * items (as many as Sec5/22, the densest siblings) PLUS one item — the concurrency determinant —
 * that cannot be a text line at all: a literal 3×3 grid of entries bracketed by delimiter bars
 * needs real 2-D space (three text ROWS, not one), not just a wider or taller single line. Rather
 * than break the single-centered-column layout (a 2-column split was considered per the task's
 * suggestion, but nothing else in this section is wide enough to need one — see WIDTH ESTIMATES
 * below — so splitting columns would only fragment reading order for no space benefit), the
 * determinant beat gets a TALLER row: label + 3 grid rows + "=0" occupy roughly 250px of vertical
 * span (y274.5-442) versus a normal row's ~20-45px. This is paid for by tightening the OTHER
 * rows' clearances down to the 24px floor (vs. the 28-30px comfort margin siblings could afford)
 * and by accepting a smaller foot margin (29px unused below the last element, vs. 45-90px in the
 * lighter siblings) — every individual clearance below is still independently verified >=24px
 * (or >=10px for the text-vs-stroke case within the determinant's own group), so nothing is
 * actually squeezed below the spec floor; the density just used up the slack. Single centered
 * column confirmed sufficient — no 2-column split needed.
 * BOXED TREATMENT: the task allows either wrapping the grid in a roundRectD outline OR letting
 * the bars carry the visual weight. Chose the latter — an outer rounded-rect AROUND vertical
 * delimiter bars would read as two nested "box" motifs fighting each other, busier than either
 * alone. Instead the determinant's bars, its 9 entries, its label and its "=0" are all rendered
 * in AMBER / AMBER_DARK (the same palette Sec5/13/22/30 already use to mark a HIGH-emphasis boxed
 * formula via Chip) — the color IS the "boxed" signal here, consistent with sibling sections'
 * HIGH visual language without a second competing outline.
 *
 * NOTATION: minus sign is a plain hyphen throughout. λ used freely (native-but-fallback Greek,
 * no plain-letter substitute, per the 6th glyph audit). ≠ native to both fonts. \frac{a}{b}
 * flattened inline as "a/b" (house convention) for the three ratio-condition formulas (parallel/
 * intersecting/coincident); the two Cramer's-rule formulas (which share one denominator) are laid
 * out SIDE BY SIDE as "x = ..." / "y = ..." rather than flattened into one run-on line or stacked
 * as true fractions (no stacked-fraction primitive exists anywhere in this codebase, and a single
 * 70-char run-on line would be markedly harder to read than the shared-denominator pair sitting
 * next to each other the way a teacher would actually write them on a board). \text{...} label
 * prefixes ("Cramer:", "Parallel:", "Intersecting:", "Coincident:", "Concurrency:", "Family:")
 * kept in English for both languages, matching every sibling toolkit section's established
 * convention (segments_hinglish itself code-switches these exact English terms). The closing
 * guardrail sentence is likewise kept identical (untranslated) in both languages, following
 * Sec13's and Sec30's precedent for full-sentence red-margin notes (both left their guardrail
 * prose in English rather than translating it) — only the always-on title differs by language.
 * Numeral subscripts (a₁ b₁ c₁, a₂ b₂ c₂, a₃ b₃ c₃, x₁ x₂, L₁ L₂) are real Unicode subscript
 * digits in non-script Anek text (script={false} on every Chip here) per the font-audit rule that
 * Kalam is missing most subscript/superscript digits.
 *
 * WIDTH ESTIMATES (0.50×size×chars, Anek non-script; over-estimate; char counts verified via
 * script, not by hand) — single centered column, all comfortably inside the 1008px-wide safe
 * span (x36-1044):
 *   b1L "Cramer: x = (b₁c₂ - b₂c₁)/(a₁b₂ - a₂b₁)"     39 ch @15 -> 292.5px (anchor end,   x558)
 *   b1R "y = (c₁a₂ - c₂a₁)/(a₁b₂ - a₂b₁)"              31 ch @15 -> 232.5px (anchor start, x582)
 *   b2  "Parallel: a₁/a₂ = b₁/b₂ ≠ c₁/c₂"               31 ch @18 -> 279.0px
 *   b3  "Intersecting: a₁/a₂ ≠ b₁/b₂"                   27 ch @18 -> 243.0px
 *   b4  "Coincident: a₁/a₂ = b₁/b₂ = c₁/c₂"              33 ch @17 -> 280.5px
 *   b5  label "Concurrency:"                             12 ch @16 -> 96.0px
 *   b5  grid entries (e.g. "a₁")                          2 ch @20 -> 20.0px each, 9 total
 *   b5  "= 0"                                              3 ch @22 -> 33.0px
 *   b6  chip "Family: L₁ + λL₂ = 0"                       20 ch @18 -> 180.0px (chip w220)
 *   b7  guardrail "The concurrency test assumes no two    68 ch @15 -> 510.0px (anchor start,
 *       of the three lines are parallel."                                       x450, ends x960)
 * Widest single-line item is b7's guardrail at 510px from x450 -> x960, 84px clear of the x1044
 * safe edge. b1's split pair spans x265.5-814.5 combined (center 540), 229.5px clear on both
 * sides. The determinant's own group (bars + grid + "=0") spans x387-694, ~350px clear on both
 * sides — by far the narrowest-relative-to-safe-width item, since its footprint is vertical, not
 * horizontal. No 2-column split needed anywhere.
