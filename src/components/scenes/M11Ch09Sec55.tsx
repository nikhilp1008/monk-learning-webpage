 * M11 Ch09 · Section 55 — "Foot, image and reflection: formula toolkit"
 * Canvas 1080×620 · safe x36–1044, y30–596. Spec: SCENE_AUTHORING.md + SCENE_AUTHORING_MATHS.md.
 * section_type: formulas — closes out the concept/formula portion of the final content subtopic
 * (Foot of Perpendicular, Image and Reflection) before worked examples 56/57/58 and the
 * tips-closer 59. Same "formula_recap / cheat_sheet" discipline as this chapter's finished sibling
 * toolkit sections (M11Ch09Sec5, Sec13, Sec22, Sec30, Sec39, Sec47 — Sec47 is the freshest direct
 * precedent, Sec5/13/22/30/39 the earlier instances of the same layout): one item per beat,
 * HIGH-emphasis formulas boxed as a Chip (CREAM fill / AMBER stroke / AMBER_DARK text),
 * normal-emphasis items as plain bold ink text, single centered column, no live derivation, no
 * math-kit diagram (pure recap, matches every sibling toolkit section's diagram-free precedent).
 * 9 board_content beats (one more than the usual 8), same count as Sec48's precedent.
 *
 * board_content seq1 is the heading ("Foot, Image & Reflection — Toolkit") -> always-on title.
 * seq2..seq9 (8 items) gate at beat>=1..beat>=8. reveals_english (9 values) = [0.0, 5.89, 22.44,
 * 29.44, 35.75, 41.3, 46.34, 50.94, 56.23]; reveals_hinglish (9 values) = [0.0, 4.52, 18.01, 23.55,
 * 30.04, 34.3, 38.23, 42.07, 47.87].
 *
 * Emphasis from JSON: seq2 (foot formula) HIGH, seq3 (image formula) HIGH, seq4 (foot = midpoint
 * of point and image) normal, seq5 (mirror y=x) normal formula, seq6 (mirror x-axis) normal
 * formula, seq7 (mirror y-axis) normal formula, seq8 (reflect a line by reflecting two points)
 * normal, seq9 (denominator a²+b², no square root) HIGH + red-margin. Two HIGH formulas -> two
 * Chips (beat1, beat2); four normal formulas/text -> plain bold ink T (beat3, beat4, beat5, beat6,
 * beat7 — five rows total, one more than the "four" count above because seq4 and seq8 are both
 * plain-prose normal rows bracketing the three mirror-formula rows); one HIGH red-margin note ->
 * the Sec1/Sec5/Sec13/Sec22/Sec30/Sec39/Sec47 red-bar + red-text convention (beat8). UNLIKE Sec30/
 * Sec47/Sec49 (which each flag TWO red-margin notes, needing a mid-list-vs-closing visual
 * distinction), this section has only ONE guardrail — it gets the plain established closing-
 * guardrail look (bar + text, alone at the foot of the board), no second-guardrail distinction
 * needed.
 *
 * TWO-CHIP PAIRING (per task instruction): the foot formula (beat1) and the image formula (beat2)
 * are algebraically the same shape — image = foot's numerator formula with an extra factor of 2 —
 * so instead of the usual ~29-30px gap between successive HIGH chips (see Sec30's b1->b2 gap), they
 * are stacked directly with a tight 14px gap (chip1 y104..148, chip2 y162..206) and given the SAME
 * box width (560px, both centered at x540) so the two rects read as a matched pair at a glance: same
 * shape, same size, "Foot:" on top / "Image:" directly below with its extra "2". 14px still clears
 * the base spec's implicit stroke-to-stroke separation (well above the 10px text-vs-stroke floor)
 * while reading visibly tighter than every other inter-row gap in this section (all >=18.47px).
 *
 * MIRROR-FAMILY RHYTHM (per task instruction): the three special-case mirror formulas (beat4 y=x,
 * beat5 x-axis, beat6 y-axis) are a natural mini-group — same "(x, y) → ..." shape, same → arrow
 * glyph, same font size (17), same weight — so they use a tighter 18.47px box-to-box gap (baseline
 * spacing 37px) versus the >=24px group-clearance floor used at every OTHER row boundary in this
 * section (title->chip1, chip2->beat3, beat3->beat4, beat6->beat7, beat7->guardrail). This is still
 * comfortably above the base spec's 14px text-vs-text floor for related/stacked content — the tight
 * rhythm is a deliberate "these three belong together" visual cue, not a squeeze.
 *
 * VERIFICATION (task-required, no-square-root consistency check): this section is a pure recap of
 * formulas already established in Sec52-54 (checked live via Supabase REST, chapter_id
 * 5edf4eb2-af54-5da2-b8fa-bfbb3270e702, positions 52-54 — all three are worked/concept sections
 * that build the SAME foot/image formula this toolkit recaps). Every formula below is
 * character-for-character consistent with the given board_content and with this chapter's running
 * variable/sign conventions: line ax+by+c=0, point (x1,y1), foot (x,y), image (x',y') — identical
 * variable names to Sec52-54. Denominator is written as (a² + b²) with NO square root anywhere in
 * this file — verified by grep, zero "√" characters present — which is exactly what the JSON's own
 * beat-9 guardrail (seq9) insists on: "no square root, unlike the distance formula" (contrasted
 * against Sec27-30's d = |Ax₁+By₁+C| / √(A²+B²), which DOES take a square root of the same
 * a²+b²-shaped denominator — the foot/image formulas divide by the RAW a²+b², never its root, and
 * that contrast is precisely the point the guardrail is teaching). Sign convention matches Sec52-54:
 * the numerator of the shared ratio is -(ax1+by1+c), i.e. the RHS carries a leading minus, and the
 * image formula is the same ratio with an extra factor of -2 (not -1) — reproduced verbatim from
 * the task's given board_content strings, no arithmetic invented here.
 *
 * BILINGUAL: following every sibling toolkit section's established convention for this exact
 * section type (all render every formula/text/guardrail row IDENTICALLY in both languages — only
 * the always-on title is translated), every row below except the title is a shared string, not run
 * through t(). Title: t("Foot, Image & Reflection — Toolkit", "Foot, Image aur Reflection — Poora
 * Toolkit") — matches Sec30/Sec39/Sec47's "— Poora Toolkit" Hinglish-title pattern exactly.
 *
 * NOTATION: minus sign is a plain hyphen throughout (no en/em-dash escape bug, checked). Apostrophe
 * (x', y' for the image point) is a plain ASCII apostrophe, native to both fonts. → is a confirmed
 * safe operator (this chapter's transformation-mapping notation, used identically across the three
 * mirror rows — see MIRROR-FAMILY RHYTHM above). ² is native to both fonts (no-fallback list).
 * Numeral subscripts (x₁, y₁) are real Unicode subscript digits in non-script Anek text — both Chip
 * calls below use explicit script={false} (Kalam is missing most subscript/superscript digits per
 * the font-audit rule; every sibling toolkit section's Chip does the same). \frac{a}{b} flattened
 * inline as "a/b" (house convention, matches every sibling's chip formulas) for both HIGH formulas.
 * The em dash "—" inside the closing guardrail (beat8, breaking the sentence into two lines) is the
 * same literal character Sec30/Sec39/Sec47's closing guardrails already use without issue, not the
 * Chapter-3 double-escaped-backslash bug (checked: no backslash-u sequences anywhere in this file).
 *
 * WIDTH ESTIMATES (0.50×size×chars, Anek non-script; over-estimate) — single centered column, all
 * comfortably inside the 1008px-wide safe span (x36-1044):
 *   b1 chip "Foot: (x - x₁)/a = (y - y₁)/b = -(ax₁ + by₁ + c)/(a² + b²)"        58 ch @16 -> 464.0px
 *   b2 chip "Image: (x' - x₁)/a = (y' - y₁)/b = -2(ax₁ + by₁ + c)/(a² + b²)"   62 ch @16 -> 496.0px
 *   b3 text "The foot is the midpoint of the point and its image."             52 ch @17 -> 442.0px
 *   b4 text "Mirror y = x: (x, y) → (y, x)"                                    29 ch @17 -> 246.5px
 *   b5 text "Mirror x-axis: (x, y) → (x, -y)"                                  31 ch @17 -> 263.5px
 *   b6 text "Mirror y-axis: (x, y) → (-x, y)"                                  31 ch @17 -> 263.5px
 *   b7 text "Reflect a line: reflect two of its points, then rejoin."          55 ch @16 -> 440.0px
 *   b8 line1 "Denominator here is a² + b² —"                                   29 ch @15 -> 217.5px
 *   b8 line2 "no square root, unlike the distance formula."                    44 ch @15 -> 330.0px
 * Widest is b2's chip at 496px text (chip w560, x260-820), 224px clear on both sides of the 1008px
 * safe span. Every other row is narrower still. Single centered column confirmed sufficient — no
 * 2-column split needed, consistent with all six sibling toolkit sections.
 *
 * Layout plan (anchor=middle at x540 for chip/text rows, anchor=start at x450 for the guardrail's
 * text, matching the established red-margin convention; Anek text box top=y-0.78×size,
 * bottom=y+0.31×size; Kalam title top=y-1.3×size, bottom=y+0.5×size; Chip box=[x,x+w]×[y,y+h]):

 * Vertical gaps (box-bottom -> next box-top): title->b1 29.0, b1->b2 14.0 (deliberate tight pair),
 * b2->b3 25.73, b3->b4 26.47, b4->b5 18.47, b5->b6 18.47 (deliberate tight family), b6->b7 26.25,
 * b7->b8bar 27.04. Every "different idea" boundary >=24 (group-clearance floor); the two
 * deliberately-tight groups (chip pair 14px, mirror family 18.47px) both clear the base 10-14px
 * text/stroke floors while visibly reading as tighter than their neighbours. Closing guardrail bar
 * bottom 496, leaving 100px of unused margin above the y596 safe floor — matches every sibling's
 * deliberate-margin discipline, plenty of headroom for this section's extra (9th) beat.
