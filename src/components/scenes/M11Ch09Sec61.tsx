 * M11 Ch09 · Section 61 — "Formula Recap II: Distance, Family, Bisectors, Reflection"
 * Canvas 1080×620 · safe x36–1044, y30–596. Spec: SCENE_AUTHORING.md + SCENE_AUTHORING_MATHS.md.
 * section_type: formula_recap — the SECOND of this chapter's two formula-recap boards (after
 * Sec60), a "notes page" moment per the formula_recap/cheat_sheet contract: every formula here
 * was already taught and verified in its own earlier section, this is the consolidated grid.
 * GRID LAYOUT borrowed from M11Ch04Sec65 (a formula_recap section from a different chapter, the
 * task's explicit precedent for the "2-col x 3-row grid of Card components + 7th full-width card"
 * layout): a reusable `Card` (title + up to 2 stacked lines) placed on COL=[60,560], CARD_W=460,
 * with a 7th card spanning the full width below the grid. BEAT-GATING follows THIS chapter's own
 * convention (established across all 59 already-authored Ch09 sections, e.g. Sec1/Sec30/Sec39/
 * Sec47/Sec55), NOT Ch04Sec65's: board_content item[0] (heading, reveal_at=0) is the ALWAYS-ON
 * title (`<Fade on={true}>`, no beat gating — Ch04Sec65 instead beat-gated its own item[0] as a
 * "subtitle", which Ch09 does not do), items[1..8] gate at beat>=1..beat>=8.
 *
 * DEVIATION FROM Ch04Sec65's EXACT ROW/CARD_H NUMBERS (documented per SCENE_AUTHORING.md Step 3 —
 * "if you deviate, your layout plan must say so"): Ch04Sec65 had 8 total beats (title + 7 cards)
 * with card7 as its LAST beat, nothing below it. This section has 9 beats — the same 7 formula
 * cards PLUS a beat-8 closing red-margin guardrail that must sit below everything. Reusing
 * Ch04Sec65's literal ROW=[112,234,356]/CARD_H=112 (card7 bottom at y=590) would leave only 6px
 * before the y=596 safe floor — not enough room for a guardrail bar+text. So the grid geometry is
 * reused in FORM (2 cols at COL=[60,560], CARD_W=460, same Card anatomy: bordered rounded rect +
 * small title + stacked formula lines, 7th card full-width below the grid) but compressed
 * vertically (CARD_H=96 vs 112, 12px inter-row gap vs Ch04Sec65's ~10px, card7 h=84 vs 100/112)
 * to free ~74px at the foot of the board for the beat-8 guardrail — verified by real box math
 * below, every clearance still clears its spec floor.
 *
 * Beats (reveals_english [0.0, 6.14, 16.64, 22.7, 27.39, 37.29, 45.31, 54.02, 60.25]; reveals_
 * hinglish [0.0, 5.12, 16.47, 22.61, 27.05, 35.67, 41.73, 49.24, 55.21]):
 *  0 (title, always-on) | "Formula Recap II: Distance, Family, Bisectors, Reflection"

 *  4 card r1c1 | concurrency determinant (flattened) + family of lines, 2 lines
 *  5 card r2c0 | angle-bisector pair (±), split across 2 lines for card width
 *  6 card r2c1 | foot of perpendicular, 1 line (GREEN — paired with card 7)
 *  7 card, full width | image/reflection formula, 1 line (GREEN — paired with card 6, same
 *    typography: same size14/weight700/anchor=start, "Foot:"/"Image:" label echo, so the two
 *    read as the same shape with only the "-2(...)" swapped in, per the task's pairing note)
 *  8 RED-MARGIN CLOSING NOTE (not a card) | "Complete toolkit for the back half — your
 *    one-glance revision board."
 *
 * CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENT — every formula below is character-for-character verified against the
 * sibling toolkit section it recaps (read directly from those files before writing this one):
 *  - card1 (distance) — M11Ch09Sec30.tsx beats 1-2 verbatim: "Point to line: d = |Ax₁ + By₁ + C|
 *    / √(A² + B²)" and "Parallel lines: d = |C₁ - C₂| / √(A² + B²)".
 *  - card2 (symmetric form) — M11Ch09Sec30.tsx beat 4 verbatim: "Symmetric form: (x - x₁)/cosθ =
 *    (y - y₁)/sinθ = r".
 *  - card3 (Cramer's rule) — M11Ch09Sec39.tsx beat 1 verbatim (split onto 2 lines, "Cramer:"
 *    prefix dropped since the card's own title already says "Cramer's Rule"): "x = (b₁c₂ -
 *    b₂c₁)/(a₁b₂ - a₂b₁)" / "y = (c₁a₂ - c₂a₁)/(a₁b₂ - a₂b₁)".
 *  - card4 (concurrency + family) — M11Ch09Sec39.tsx beat 5's determinant (a₁ b₁ c₁ / a₂ b₂ c₂ /
 *    a₃ b₃ c₃ = 0, same 9 entries/subscripts) FLATTENED to one inline pipe-delimited line per the
 *    task's explicit space constraint (a literal drawn 3×3 grid, Sec39's own construction, does
 *    not fit a ~460×96 card — see DETERMINANT FLATTENING note below) plus beat 6's family formula
 *    verbatim: "L₁ + λL₂ = 0".
 *  - card5 (angle bisector) — M11Ch09Sec47.tsx beat 1 verbatim, split at the "=" onto 2 lines for
 *    card width: "(a₁x + b₁y + c₁) / √(a₁² + b₁²) =" / "±(a₂x + b₂y + c₂) / √(a₂² + b₂²)".
 *  - card6 (foot) — M11Ch09Sec55.tsx beat 1 verbatim: "Foot: (x - x₁)/a = (y - y₁)/b =
 *    -(ax₁ + by₁ + c)/(a² + b²)".
 *  - card7 (image) — M11Ch09Sec55.tsx beat 2 verbatim: "Image: (x' - x₁)/a = (y' - y₁)/b =
 *    -2(ax₁ + by₁ + c)/(a² + b²)".
 * No arithmetic, variable name, or sign convention was invented here — every string above is
 * copied byte-for-byte from its source section (only re-wrapped onto multiple lines where the
 * card's 460px width required it; the wrap point never splits inside a token).
 *
 * DETERMINANT FLATTENING DECISION (card4, task-flagged as the hardest layout call): Sec38/39's
 * literal construction (2 Draw delimiter bars + a 3×3 grid of <T> entries, ~130px tall on its own)
 * does not fit inside a ~460×96 recap card alongside a title and a second formula (family). Per
 * the task's explicit fallback instruction, flattened to one inline pipe-delimited line instead:
 * "Concurrency: |a₁ b₁ c₁; a₂ b₂ c₂; a₃ b₃ c₃| = 0" — single "|...|" pair brackets the whole
 * flattened block (the standard determinant notation, a bar on each side of the matrix), rows
 * separated by "; " so the 3×3 structure is still legible as 3 groups of 3 rather than reading as
 * 9 flat entries. At size 13 this is 47 chars ≈ 305.5px (0.50×13×47), comfortably inside the
 * card's ~420px usable width (34px+ clear of both edges) — legible-at-a-glance, not a redrawn
 * teaching moment (that stays owned by Sec38/39, per the task's explicit instruction not to
 * reattempt the drawn-bars construction here).
 *
 * BILINGUAL: following every sibling toolkit section's established convention (Sec30/39/47/55 —
 * formula/text rows render identically in both languages, only the always-on title is translated
 * via t()), every card title/line below is a SHARED string, not run through t() (task confirms:
 * "Formula card text can be shared... since these are symbolic formulas"). Only the section title
 * (beat 0) and the closing red-margin note (beat 8) use t().
 *
 * NOTATION: minus sign is a plain hyphen throughout (matches every source section, no en/em-dash
 * escape bug). λ used freely (safe-fallback Greek, established since Sec36/37, reused verbatim
 * from Sec39's family formula). θ used freely (this chapter's most-used symbol, native-but-
 * fallback per the 3rd/7th glyph audits). √ ² ± are native to both fonts (no-fallback list).
 * Absolute value "|...|" is plain U+007C (native), never U+2223. Apostrophe in "x'"/"y'" (image
 * point) is plain ASCII U+0027 (native), matching Sec55's own confirmation. Numeral subscripts
 * (x₁, y₁, A₁, B₁, C₁, a₁, b₁, c₁, a₂...) are real Unicode subscript digits in non-script Anek
 * text (every <T> below has script=false, the T default) per the font-audit rule that Kalam is
 * missing most subscript/superscript digits — matches every sibling toolkit section.
 *
 * COLOR CHOICE (documented, since it deviates from Ch04Sec65's card-color scheme): cards 1-5 use
 * AMBER_DARK (the standard formula-card border, matching Sec30/39/47/55's AMBER/AMBER_DARK "boxed
 * formula" language). Cards 6-7 (foot + image) both use GREEN instead — the deliberate visual
 * pairing signal the task asked for ("same shape, factor of 2"), distinct from the other five
 * one-off formulas. RED is reserved exclusively for the beat-8 closing guardrail (this chapter's
 * highest-emphasis signal) — Ch04Sec65 used RED on its own full-width 7th card, but doing that
 * here would visually conflate two different RED elements (a card border vs. the actual guardrail
 * bar) with different meanings on the same board, so card 7 is GREEN like card 6, not RED.
 *
 * WIDTH ESTIMATES (0.50×size×chars, Anek non-script; over-estimate; char counts cross-checked
 * against Sec30/39/47/55's own header comments where the string is copied verbatim from them) —
 * every card line comfortably inside its card's usable width (card interior = w-20 from the
 * left-padded start x to the card's right edge; cards 1-6 usable ≈440px, card7 usable ≈940px):
 *   card1 L1 "Point to line: d = |Ax₁ + By₁ + C| / √(A² + B²)"   47ch@13 -> 305.5px
 *   card1 L2 "Parallel lines: d = |C₁ - C₂| / √(A² + B²)"        42ch@13 -> 273.0px
 *   card2 L1 "Symmetric form: (x - x₁)/cosθ = (y - y₁)/sinθ = r" 49ch@14 -> 343.0px
 *   card3 L1 "x = (b₁c₂ - b₂c₁)/(a₁b₂ - a₂b₁)"                   32ch@13 -> 208.0px
 *   card3 L2 "y = (c₁a₂ - c₂a₁)/(a₁b₂ - a₂b₁)"                   32ch@13 -> 208.0px
 *   card4 L1 "Concurrency: |a₁ b₁ c₁; a₂ b₂ c₂; a₃ b₃ c₃| = 0"   47ch@13 -> 305.5px
 *   card4 L2 "Family: L₁ + λL₂ = 0"                               20ch@13 -> 130.0px
 *   card5 L1 "(a₁x + b₁y + c₁) / √(a₁² + b₁²) ="                 33ch@13 -> 214.5px
 *   card5 L2 "±(a₂x + b₂y + c₂) / √(a₂² + b₂²)"                  33ch@13 -> 214.5px
 *   card6 L1 "Foot: (x - x₁)/a = (y - y₁)/b = -(ax₁ + by₁ + c)/(a² + b²)"   58ch@14 -> 406.0px
 *   card7 L1 "Image: (x' - x₁)/a = (y' - y₁)/b = -2(ax₁ + by₁ + c)/(a² + b²)" 62ch@14 -> 434.0px
 *   guardrail (EN, longer of the two languages) "Complete toolkit for the back half — your
 *     one-glance revision board."                                69ch@15 -> 517.5px (anchor start
 *     x450 -> right edge 967.5, 76.5px clear of the x1044 safe edge)
 * Widest grid-card line is card6's foot formula (406px in a ~440px usable card width, 34px+
 * clear); no card line comes close to overflowing. No 2-column-within-card split ever needed.
