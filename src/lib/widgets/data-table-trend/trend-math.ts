/**
 * data_table_trend — a series of values side by side, and where the trend
 * breaks.
 *
 * Nothing here is a worklet. The one animatable param (`highlight_row`) moves
 * a single Rect's y and needs no maths on the UI thread, so this file is plain
 * TypeScript with zero imports — which is what lets its assertions run before
 * any React exists.
 *
 * WHAT THIS WIDGET ACTUALLY COMPUTES. The cell values are payload inputs, so
 * asserting "Li = 520" would test the payload, not the widget. The widget's own
 * output is the READING of the series: its direction, its span, and the indices
 * where a local step opposes the overall direction. That last one is the
 * teaching point of the chapter this widget exists for — NCERT's period-2
 * ionisation-enthalpy table is memorable precisely because of the Be→B and N→O
 * dips, and a widget that FINDS them is doing the work rather than being told
 * the answer.
 *
 * Reference results (independently recomputed before this file was written):
 *
 *   First ionisation enthalpy, period 2 — NCERT Cl.11 Chem Unit 3, kJ/mol
 *     [520, 899, 801, 1086, 1402, 1314, 1681, 2081]   (Li Be B C N O F Ne)
 *       trendSign +1, netChange 1561, span 1561
 *       anomalyCount 2, firstAnomaly 2      <- B (filled 2s) and O (half-filled 2p)
 *
 *   Atomic radii down group 1 — NCERT Cl.11 Unit 3, metallic radii pm
 *     [152, 186, 227, 248, 265]            (Li Na K Rb Cs)
 *       trendSign +1, netChange 113, span 113, anomalyCount 0, firstAnomaly -1
 *
 *   Lanthanoid contraction — NCERT Cl.12 Unit 4, Ln3+ ionic radii pm
 *     [106, 99, 94, 88, 85]                (La Nd Gd Er Lu)
 *       trendSign -1, netChange -21, span 21, anomalyCount 0, firstAnomaly -1
 *
 *   Electron gain enthalpy, group 17 — SIGNED, kJ/mol
 *     [-328, -349, -325, -295]             (F Cl Br I)
 *       trendSign +1, netChange 33, span 54, anomalyCount 1, firstAnomaly 1
 *       ^ the famous F < Cl exception falls straight out of the same detector.
 *         Values must stay SIGNED: feeding magnitudes flips every sign and
 *         silently inverts the result.
 *
 * The two zero-anomaly fixtures are as load-bearing as the two that find them —
 * a detector that always fires is not a detector
 * (docs/small-screen-rendering-rules.md, "every assertion needs a fixture that
 * fails it").
