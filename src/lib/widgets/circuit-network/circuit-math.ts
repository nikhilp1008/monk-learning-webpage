/**
 * circuit_network — the REDUCTION of a lumped two-terminal network drawn on a
 * NAMED TOPOLOGY, plus every coordinate that drawing needs.
 *
 * Nothing here is a worklet. The two animatable params move a charge-fill quad
 * and an arrowhead along ONE straight segment whose endpoints are fixed by
 * `params`, and rotate ONE needle about a fixed centre; all three centres and
 * endpoints are computed here on the JS thread, so the only arithmetic left on
 * the UI thread is `a + (b - a) * t`, `Math.exp` and one `cos/sin` pair. That
 * is why this file imports nothing but `../chrome` (which imports nothing),
 * which is what lets its assertions run before any React exists.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT IS IN SCOPE, AND WHAT WAS DELIBERATELY SPLIT OUT
 *
 * IN: the lumped DC / reactive network — resistors, capacitors, inductors, a
 * cell, a switch, a galvanometer, a lamp, wired into one of six named shapes,
 * and reduced to an equivalent.
 *
 * OUT, and each for a structural reason rather than a scheduling one:
 *   - PHASORS (`ac_phasor` is its own widget). A phasor diagram has no
 *     topology at all — it is two arrows and an angle — so a topology-typed
 *     slot list has nothing to say about it.
 *   - LOGIC GATES. A gate network is a directed acyclic GRAPH, which is
 *     `process_flow`/`reaction_scheme`'s problem, not a two-terminal
 *     reduction: there is no such thing as the equivalent resistance of an
 *     AND gate.
 *   - p-n JUNCTIONS. A depletion region has no elements and no nodes; it is a
 *     one-dimensional field profile, i.e. an `xy_plot`.
 *   - TRANSFORMERS. Two magnetically coupled loops are not one two-terminal
 *     network, and the turns ratio is the whole lesson rather than an
 *     equivalent.
 * If a concept needs one of those, it is OUT OF SCOPE for this widget. Do not
 * widen the kind list to reach it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * NAMED TOPOLOGIES WITH TYPED SLOTS, NEVER A NETLIST.
 *
 * The model sends `topology` plus an ORDERED element list whose position in
 * the list IS its place in the drawing. It never sends nodes, edges or
 * coordinates. Auto-placement was considered and rejected, for three reasons
 * that are worth keeping written down because "just lay out the netlist" is
 * the obvious-looking answer:
 *
 *   1. It RELOCATES the layout problem into the widget rather than removing
 *      it. Somebody still has to decide where the resistor goes; a placer
 *      just makes that decision unreviewable.
 *   2. scripts/verify-render.mjs assertion 4 is a HARD ERROR on any two
 *      overlapping text boxes. A placer can TRY to avoid that; it cannot
 *      GUARANTEE it, so every generated payload becomes a coin flip against
 *      CI. A named topology with a fixed slot count can be checked ONCE, by
 *      arithmetic, for every payload the schema admits.
 *   3. The syllabus needs six shapes, not arbitrary graphs. Six is a list.
 *
 * SLOT ORDER, per topology — this is the contract the payload is written to:
 *
 *   series           0..n-1 left to right along the top rail          n = 1..4
 *   parallel         0..n-1 top to bottom, one branch each            n = 2..3
 *   series_parallel  [A1, A2, B1, B2] — two two-branch banks in series    n = 4
 *   ladder           [series1, shunt1, series2, shunt2]                   n = 4
 *   bridge           [P (N-W arm), Q (N-E arm), R (W-S arm),
 *                     S (E-S arm), galvanometer]                          n = 5
 *   two_loop         [top-left, bottom-left, middle, top-right,
 *                     bottom-right, right]                                n = 6
 *
 * THE UNIT IS FIXED BY `kind` AND IS NEVER SUPPLIED AS TEXT. resistor/lamp/
 * galvanometer are ohms, capacitor is microfarad, inductor is millihenry,
 * cell is volts, switch has no value to show. A free-text "10 ohm" would be
 * unparseable by computeDerived, unbounded for the collision arithmetic below
 * (a 14-character value string is 97pt wide against a 52pt cell pitch), and an
 * alignment hazard the moment a caption quotes it. The widget formats the
 * display string itself: `fmtOhms(4700)` is `"4.7 kΩ"`, never `"4.700 kΩ"`.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * REFERENCE VALUES — computed by hand, cited, then asserted in
 * lib/widgets/__tests__/physics.test.ts. Each one is chosen so that a stub
 * cannot pass it.
 *
 *  1. COMBINATION OF RESISTORS + terminal voltage.
 *     NCERT Class 12 Physics Part I, Ch.3 "Current Electricity" (combination
 *     of resistors; V = ε − I r).
 *       topology series_parallel, banks {4 Ω, 4 Ω} and {12 Ω, 6 Ω},
 *       ε = 16 V, r = 1 Ω.
 *         4‖4  = 16/8  = 2 Ω
 *         12‖6 = 72/18 = 4 Ω
 *         r_eq = 2 + 4 = 6 Ω,   total = 6 + 1 = 7 Ω
 *         i_total    = 16/7        = 2.285714 A
 *         terminal_v = 16 − 2.285714(1) = 13.714286 V
 *         power      = (16/7)² × 6 = (256/49) × 6 = 31.346939 W
 *     SELF-CHECKING: terminal_v must ALSO equal i_total × r_eq
 *     (2.285714 × 6 = 13.714286). Two independent routes to one number, so a
 *     sign slip in `ε − I r` cannot pass quietly.
 *
 *  2. METRE BRIDGE.
 *     Same chapter. Standard resistance R in slot 0, null point at 53.5 cm:
 *       r_unknown = R (100 − l)/l = 6 × 46.5 / 53.5 = 5.214953 Ω
 *     Deliberately OFF the 50 cm mark: at 50 cm the answer is R itself, so a
 *     stub that returns slot 0's value would pass. At 53.5 it returns 6 and
 *     fails by 15%.
 *
 *  2b. THE UNBALANCED BRIDGE'S r_eq — delta-star, see `bridgeDeltaStar`.
 *     Same chapter's Wheatstone network, driven off balance so the
 *     galvanometer branch carries current and therefore matters:
 *       P 6, Q 4, R 3, S 5, G 50   →  4.481633 Ω   (old formula: 4.5, +0.41%)
 *       P 6, Q 3, R 4, S 5, G 50   →  4.426096 Ω   (old formula: 4.444, +0.41%)
 *       P 6, Q 3, R 4, S 5, G 0.5  →  4.244444 Ω   (old formula: 4.444, +4.71%)
 *     Each derived twice — once by the Δ–Y reduction and once by a
 *     branch-current (Kirchhoff) solve: five unknown branch currents, two KCL
 *     equations and three KVL loops, put through Gaussian elimination. That
 *     route shares no algebra with the Δ–Y one, which is the property this
 *     widget's previous `terminal_v === i_total * r_eq` self-check lacked —
 *     `V − i·r ≡ i·R` is an identity and cannot fail however wrong r_eq is,
 *     which is exactly how this defect stayed green. The old
 *     `(P+R) ‖ (Q+S)` is the G → ∞ limit of all three, which is why the error
 *     GROWS as G falls: the branch it deletes is the one carrying the current.
 *     BALANCED bridges are the regression guard rather than a fixture: at
 *     P/Q = R/S the new answer must equal the old one to floating point, and
 *     must not depend on G at all.
 *
 *  3. RC CHARGING.
 *     NCERT Class 12 Part I, Ch.3 / Ch.2 (RC time constant, V_C = V(1 − e^−t/τ)).
 *       topology series, [resistor 20 kΩ, capacitor 5 µF], ε = 12 V
 *         τ = RC = 20000 × 5×10⁻⁶ = 0.1 s exactly
 *       The widget's charge animation runs t over a CHARGE_WINDOW_TAU = 2.5 τ
 *       window, so t_frac 0.4 is exactly one τ and t_frac 1 is 2.5 τ:
 *         V_C(t_frac 0.4) = 12(1 − e⁻¹)   = 7.585447 V
 *         V_C(t_frac 1.0) = 12(1 − e⁻²·⁵) = 11.014980 V
 *     A stub LINEAR in t_frac returns 12 × 0.4 = 4.8 V at the τ point — a 58%
 *     error no tolerance hides, which is exactly why the exponential is
 *     asserted at a fraction rather than at the endpoints (0 and 1 agree by
 *     construction for any monotone stub).
 *
 *  4. CAPACITORS IN SERIES.
 *     NCERT Class 12 Part I, Ch.2 "Electrostatic Potential and Capacitance"
 *     (1/C = Σ 1/Cᵢ; U = ½CV²).
 *       topology series, [2 µF, 3 µF, 4 µF], V = 12 V
 *         1/C = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 = 6/12 + 4/12 + 3/12 = 13/12
 *         c_eq = 12/13 = 0.923077 µF
 *         Q    = c_eq V = 11.076923 µC
 *         U    = ½ c_eq V² = 0.5 × 0.923077 × 144 = 66.461538 µJ
 *     Every plausible stub fails VISIBLY: summing gives 9, averaging gives 3,
 *     the parallel formula gives 9. Only the reciprocal sum gives 0.92.
 *
 *  5. SERIES LCR AT RESONANCE.
 *     NCERT Class 12 Part I, Ch.7 "Alternating Current", the chapter's own
 *     worked values: L = 5.0 H, C = 80 µF, R = 40 Ω.
 *       topology series, [resistor 40 Ω, inductor 5000 mH, capacitor 80 µF]
 *         ω₀ = 1/√(LC) = 1/√(5 × 80×10⁻⁶) = 1/√(4×10⁻⁴) = 1/0.02 = 50 rad/s
 *         f₀ = ω₀/2π = 7.957747 Hz
 *         Q  = ω₀L/R = 50 × 5 / 40 = 6.25
 *     A stub that returns ω₀ where f₀ was asked — the commonest bug in this
 *     formula — answers 50 instead of 7.96 and fails loudly. Note the unit
 *     conversion this fixture also pins: the payload carries 5000 mH, not 5.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE CAPS, AND THE ARITHMETIC THEY COME FROM.
 *
 * Measured at 343x236 — `spec-small`, the smallest board this app checks
 * (docs/small-screen-rendering-rules.md). A floor derived at 900x430 is not a
 * floor. Enforced in validate(), never by thinning the render.
 *
 *   usable width  = 343 − 2·PAD_SIDE(12)                       = 319
 *   rail          = 319 − 2·CORNER(14)                         = 291
 *   usable height = 236 − READOUT_BAND(28.4) − PAD_EDGE(10)    = 197.6
 *
 * LABEL CAPS — this is what closes the dense-mesh risk.
 *   name  ≤ 3 characters
 *   value display ≤ 6 characters, and the widget writes it, not the model
 *   6 × LABEL_SIZE(12) × CHAR_W(0.58) = 41.76pt of text
 *   against CELL_PITCH 52                     ⇒ 10.24pt clear
 *   7 characters would be 48.72pt             ⇒ only 3.28pt clear
 * So `fmtOhms` must emit "4.7 kΩ" and never "4.700 kΩ"; the unit is chosen so
 * the mantissa always lands in [1, 1000) and the whole string fits in 6.
 *
 * Two stacked labels per cell need a baseline separation of at least one text
 * line, LABEL_SIZE × 1.15 = 13.8pt; LABEL_STACK is 14. The pair plus its
 * clearance from the wire reserves 40pt on the label side of that wire
 * (name box top at y−35.84 through value box bottom at y−8.04 is 27.8, plus
 * 8.04 of wire clearance and ~4 of margin).
 *
 * SLOT COUNTS, fixed by topology:
 *   series           1..4   4 × 52 = 208 ≤ 291 (83pt spare).
 *                           6 × 52 = 312 > 291 — arithmetically impossible.
 *                           5 × 52 = 260 fits the pitch but leaves 31pt of
 *                           slack across the WHOLE rail, under one cell of
 *                           margin, so the cap is set at 4.
 *   parallel         2..3   3 × 52 branch pitch + 28 of rail ends = 184 ≤ 197.6.
 *                           4 would need 4 × 52 + 28 = 236 > 197.6 — fails.
 *   series_parallel  = 4    two banks of two.
 *   ladder           = 4    two series arms, two shunts.
 *   bridge           = 5    four arms and the galvanometer.
 *   two_loop         = 6    the six branches of a two-mesh network.
 *
 * REJECT, NEVER PAD. An `elements.length` that does not match the topology is
 * an ERROR: padding with a default resistor invents circuit the model did not
 * send, and a student reading "R₄ = 1 Ω" off a board where the model named
 * three resistors is being shown a fabricated answer.
 *
 * THE ONE GENUINE GLYPH HAZARD, and it lives in `bridge`. The source symbol
 * and the galvanometer are BOTH circles at GLYPH_R = 10, so verify-render
 * assertion 8 demands 2r + 4 = 24pt between them. They sit on opposite
 * diagonals — galvanometer at the centre of the W–E detector diagonal, source
 * outside the diamond on the N–S supply diagonal — but LONG ARM LABELS SHRINK
 * THE DIAMOND, and a shrunk diamond brings them together. So `bridgeGeometry`
 * enforces a floor of HALF_DIAG_MIN = 40pt on BOTH half-diagonals, and
 * `fitProblems` REJECTS a payload whose arm and galvanometer labels do not
 * clear each other AT THAT FLOOR. It does not shrink the floor to fit.
 *   worked: the binding pair at the floor is the galvanometer's own label,
 *   centred under its circle and half of 41.76 = 20.88pt wide, against the SE
 *   arm label which starts at hx/2 + 10 = 30pt from the centre. 30 − 20.88 =
 *   9.12pt of clearance at hx = 40, and 0 at hx = 21.76. Raising
 *   MAX_VALUE_CHARS to 9 (w/2 = 31.3) would make the floor insufficient and
 *   fitProblems would say so, which is the point of checking rather than
 *   asserting.

/**
 * THE UNBALANCED WHEATSTONE BRIDGE, by the delta-star (Δ–Y) transformation.
 *
 * The five arms sit on four nodes — A (N, the supply's + corner), B (S, its −
 * corner), C (W) and D (E):
 *
 *        A                 P: A–C     R: C–B
 *       / \                Q: A–D     S: D–B
 *      P   Q               G: C–D, the galvanometer, on the OTHER diagonal
 *     /     \
 *    C ——G—— D             r_eq is measured across A–B.
 *     \     /
 *      R   S
 *       \ /
 *        B
 *
 * No two arms are in series and no two are in parallel, so no amount of
 * series/parallel folding reduces this. THAT is why the widget used to answer
 * `(P + R) ‖ (Q + S)` — the answer you get by deleting G — and why that answer
 * is exact ONLY at balance (P/Q = R/S), where no current flows through G and
 * deleting it changes nothing. Off balance it is simply wrong, and this widget
 * ANIMATES `bridge_delta`: it draws the deflected needle of an unbalanced
 * bridge while reporting the balanced bridge's resistance. Measured error of
 * the old formula against the answer below: 0.41% at P6 Q3 R4 S5 G50, 4.7% at
 * the same arms with G 0.5, and 5000.005 Ω against a true 0.030 Ω at the
 * schema's own extremes (P 0.01, Q 10000, R 10000, S 0.01, G 0.01).
 *
 * THE TRANSFORMATION. Take the Δ on {A, C, D} — that is arms P (A–C), Q (A–D)
 * and G (C–D) — and replace it with the Y that is indistinguishable from it at
 * those three terminals. With Σ = P + Q + G, the standard result is that each
 * star arm is the product of the two Δ arms MEETING at its terminal, over Σ:
 *
 *     A–N:  Rₐ = P·Q / Σ        (P and Q meet at A)
 *     N–C:  R_c = P·G / Σ       (P and G meet at C)
 *     N–D:  R_d = Q·G / Σ       (Q and G meet at D)
 *
 * The bridge is now a plain ladder — A–N, then two legs back to B — so:
 *
 *     r_eq = Rₐ + (R_c + R) ‖ (R_d + S)
 *
 * EXACT AT BALANCE, and this is the regression guard on the whole change.
 * Put P = kQ and R = kS. Then Σ = Q(k+1) + G, and
 *     R_c + R = k·(QG + S·Σ)/Σ = k·T,   R_d + S = (QG + S·Σ)/Σ = T,
 * so the parallel pair is kT²/(T(k+1)) = kT/(k+1) and
 *     r_eq = kQ²/Σ + k(QG + S·Σ)/(Σ(k+1))
 *          = k[(k+1)Q(Q+S) + G(Q+S)] / (Σ(k+1))
 *          = k(Q+S)·Σ / (Σ(k+1))  =  k(Q+S)/(k+1),
 * which is exactly (P+R) ‖ (Q+S) = k(Q+S)²/((k+1)(Q+S)) — and G has cancelled
 * out, as it must. Asserted numerically in `__tests__/bridge-delta-star.test.ts`
 * over a sweep of balanced bridges, both ways, to floating point.
 *
 * DEGENERATE INPUTS THE SCHEMA ADMITS.
 *  - G → 0, a galvanometer that is a dead short. Σ is still P + Q, Rₐ becomes
 *    P ‖ Q and R_c = R_d = 0, giving P‖Q + R‖S — the right answer for C and D
 *    being one node. Nothing divides by zero. (`validate()` puts a
 *    galvanometer in slot 4 and floors every value at VALUE_MIN = 0.01, so
 *    G is never actually 0; the formula does not need it to be non-zero.)
 *  - G → ∞, an open detector. Rₐ → 0, R_c → P, R_d → Q, so the expression
 *    collapses BACK to (P+R) ‖ (Q+S). At the schema ceiling G = 10 MΩ with
 *    6/3/4/5 arms it agrees with the old formula to 7 significant figures
 *    (4.4444443 against 4.4444444), which is the sense in which the old
 *    answer was one special case of this one.
 *  - AN ARM AT EITHER SCHEMA EXTREME. The largest intermediate this can form
 *    is a product of two 10 MΩ arms, 1e14 — thirteen orders of magnitude
 *    inside a double's range, so there is no overflow corner to guard and no
 *    payload the schema admits that has no finite answer. The 32 corners of
 *    {0.01, 1e7}^5 are swept against the independent branch-current solve in
 *    the test file rather than argued for here.
 *  - AN ARM THAT IS NOT RESISTIVE AT ALL — a capacitor or inductor in an arm,
 *    which `validate()` admits (no parallel bank mixes families). Its
 *    resistance is 0, i.e. a WIRE, and the transformation handles that
 *    correctly on its own: P = 0 shorts A to C, and the formula then returns
 *    R ‖ ((Q‖G) + S), which is the network that is actually drawn.
 *
 * `parR` returns 0 whenever a branch is 0 and documents that as "this branch
 * holds no resistive element". Every number reaching it here is a computed leg
 * rather than a slot, so 0 means the other thing — a genuine 0 Ω short — but
 * the two readings give the SAME number, and it is the right one: a short
 * across the pair is 0 Ω. Both routes to a zero leg check out. R_c + R = 0
 * needs P = 0 and R = 0, which shorts A to B, and Rₐ = P·Q/Σ is then also 0,
 * so r_eq is 0 — correct. G = 0 with R = 0 makes C = D = B, and the formula
 * returns P‖Q + 0 — also correct.
