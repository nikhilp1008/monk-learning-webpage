/**
 * Layout maths for the `labelled_figure` illustration tier.
 *
 * Implements docs/label-layer.md §1.3 (the letterbox arithmetic), §2.2 (two
 * columns pinned to the art, leaders back to the anchor), §2.3 (deterministic
 * vertical de-collision) and §2.4 (the schema caps, derived at 343x236) —
 * with one structural change the spec did not anticipate, recorded in
 * "WHERE THE SPEC IS WRONG" below.
 *
 * No React and no react-native import in this file, on purpose — same reason
 * `projectile-motion/physics.ts` is separate: this is the part that needs
 * reviewing as geometry, and it is the part the tests assert over directly.
 *
 * THE FRAME RULE (docs/small-screen-rendering-rules.md), applied to labels:
 * a label's POSITION is a world quantity and scales with the board; its FONT
 * SIZE is chrome and never does. Every constant below is one or the other and
 * says which.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHERE THE SPEC IS WRONG: the 10-label cap is a wall, not a cap.
 *
 * docs/label-layer.md §2.4 proposes "cap: 10 per figure" and adds that "a
 * figure that genuinely needs 18 labels is two figures". Measured against the
 * real work order (48 anchored biology plates, `illustration-manifest.csv`):
 *
 *     labels per figure   min 6   median 11.5   max 28   total 595
 *     figures over 10     28 of 48  (58%)
 *
 * The spec's cap therefore rejects the majority of the corpus, and "it is two
 * figures" is not available: `must_show` binds each figure to ONE anchor
 * plate — cockroach morphology AND digestive system is one 1886 Miall & Denny
 * engraving — so splitting the figure means re-sourcing the art.
 *
 * The resolution is that the cap is per GROUP, not per figure. A figure
 * declares ordered subsets ("digestive", "nervous"), each within the cap, and
 * the board draws one at a time — selected by the existing `Cue.seq` track, so
 * the labels on screen are the ones the narration is talking about. See
 * `MAX_LABELS_PER_GROUP` and `boardCapacity` for the measured numbers this
 * rests on.
