/**
 * `labelled_figure`'s validation — ONE path, shared by the runtime and the gate.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS ITS OWN FILE. It used to live in `index.tsx`, and the publish
 * gate (`scripts/gate-label-set.mjs`) therefore could not call it: `index.tsx`
 * imports `react-native-svg` at module scope, which a bare node script cannot
 * resolve. So the gate ran `validateLabelSet` + `gateLabelSet` instead — a
 * SECOND, similar, not-identical set of checks.
 *
 * That gap was measured, not theorised. The Taenia set passed the gate at all
 * five frames and the runtime then refused it, because the anchor floor
 * (`tooCloseAnchors`, 2r+4 = 10pt at 343x236) lived in `validate()` alone:
 * `hook` and `sucker` were 5.6pt apart, the widget refused the payload, and
 * the student got a blank board on a set the gate had passed.
 *
 * Nothing in here touches React, react-native-svg or the DOM, and nothing may.
 * That is the property that lets the gate import the real function rather than
 * approximate it. `index.tsx` re-exports it, so the widget module is unchanged.

   * layout gate was green at all five frames, the bytes verified against R2,
   * and the resolver reported "5 labels, 0 missing" over an empty rectangle.
   *
   * So label faults are collected here instead: the offending labels are
