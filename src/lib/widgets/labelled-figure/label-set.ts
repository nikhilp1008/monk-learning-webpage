/**
 * The LABEL SET: the wire format an author writes and the resolver reads.
 *
 * One JSON per asset, stored beside its `concept_assets` row. This is what
 * turns a plate into a figure — the art is the same picture with or without it,
 * and the labels are the whole teaching payload.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE SHAPE FROM `LabelRecord`
 * ----------------------------------------------
 * `figure-layout.ts` already defines what the RENDERER consumes: `term`,
 * `anchor: {u, v}`, `side: 'left' | 'right'`, a required `group`. That shape is
 * tuned for layout and is not a good authoring format — `{u, v}` is a worse
 * thing to type than `[x, y]`, and `left | right` is a rendering decision an
 * author should be able to defer.
 *
 * So there are two shapes and one converter (`toFigureRecord`). The wire format
 * is what the authoring tool writes and what ships in the bucket; the record is
 * what the widget draws. Keeping them separate is what lets the renderer change
 * its mind about placement without invalidating 65 authored files.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY STRICT
 * ---------------------------
 * Every refusal below exists because the alternative renders as something
 * plausible and wrong, which is worse for a figure than for anything else on
 * the board: a mislabelled diagram teaches the wrong word with full confidence.
