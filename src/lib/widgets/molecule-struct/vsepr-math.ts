/**
 * molecule_struct — one central atom, its ligands, and the SHAPE that follows
 * from counting electron domains. Group A only: a single centre with ligands
 * placed by electron-domain count. Backbone walks (Fischer/Haworth projections,
 * peptide chains) are a different widget; Newman projections are deferred.
 *
 * Nothing here is a worklet, deliberately. The one animatable param
 * (`highlight_site`) moves a single MARKER_R circle around the site ring, and
 * the only arithmetic that has to happen on the UI thread is one angle lerp
 * plus a cos/sin — small enough to live inside the component's own worklet.
 * So this file imports nothing but `../chrome` (which itself imports nothing),
 * which is what lets its assertions run before any React exists.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * THE MODEL EMITS NO GEOMETRY — AND NAMES NO SHAPE
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * This is stronger than CLAUDE.md §3's "the model never emits coordinates".
 * The payload states only chemistry the model actually knows:
 *
 *     centre, bond_pairs, lone_pairs, ligands[], bond_orders[], charge
 *
 * It does NOT say "tetrahedral", does not say "sp3", does not say "109.5", and
 * does not say where anything goes. Shape, hybridisation, both angles and every
 * coordinate are looked up in the closed AXE table below from (bond_pairs,
 * lone_pairs) alone. A model that could name the shape could name the WRONG
 * shape — asking it for "trigonal pyramidal" and drawing what it said would be
 * the same class of defect as asking it for an SVG path.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * THE DRAWN ANGLE AND THE REPORTED ANGLE ARE DELIBERATELY DIFFERENT NUMBERS
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * 109.5 degrees CANNOT BE DRAWN IN A PLANE. A tetrahedron has four bonds at
 * 109.5 to each other in three dimensions; every 2D depiction of methane ever
 * printed draws them 90 degrees apart on the page and writes "109.5" beside
 * them. That is not an approximation, it is a PROJECTION, and the two numbers
 * are different quantities:
 *
 *   `bondSites`  — a per-shape 2D DRAWING CONVENTION, in screen degrees. It is
 *                  chosen for legibility (labels that clear each other, lone
 *                  pairs where VSEPR puts them) and carries NO physical claim.
 *   `bondAngle`  — the PHYSICAL angle, from NCERT. It is what the readout and
 *                  the angle annotation print, and it is never computed from
 *                  the drawing.
 *
 * Nothing in this file derives one from the other, in either direction.
 * Conflating them — drawing the bonds 109.5 apart in the plane and calling it
 * methane, or measuring the drawn angle and reporting it — is exactly the
 * "approximately right" defect CLAUDE.md §1 exists to prevent. Our students
 * read values off these diagrams; the value they read must be the one from the
 * table, not the one the pixels happen to make.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * `angle_override` — THE NAMED EXCEPTION, AND WHY IT IS AN OBJECT
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * The AXE table is keyed on (bond_pairs, lone_pairs), so ONE row serves every
 * species with that domain count. AX2E1 serves ozone (NCERT 117) and SO2
 * (~119) alike and reports the idealised 117.5 for both. That is the VSEPR
 * model behaving as taught, and the row is not touched.
 *
 * What a payload may add is the measurement, when it knows the species:
 *
 *     angle_override: { bond: 117 }                 O3
 *     angle_override: { bond: 119 }                 SO2
 *     angle_override: { bond: 107 }                 NH3   (== the table)
 *     angle_override: { bond: 104.5 }               H2O   (== the table)
 *     angle_override: { bond: 101.6, secondary: 87.4 }    SF4
 *
 * AN OBJECT, NOT A NUMBER, and the reason is the SN-5 and SN-6 rows. Seven of
 * the fourteen rows have TWO distinct angles and the readout prints both on
 * one line — `sp3d   trigonal bipyramidal   120° / 90°`. A scalar override
 * could correct only the first of the two, leaving the second idealised under
 * a single provenance word describing both. So on a row that has a second
 * angle the override must supply BOTH, and on a row that has none `secondary`
 * is refused: the line is then all-measured or all-derived, never half of
 * each. That is the entire argument for the shape.
 *
 * AN OVERRIDE THAT AGREES IS INERT. `overridden` below is computed by
 * comparing the resulting NUMBERS against the table, never by asking whether
 * the key was present — so NH3 107 and H2O 104.5, which are exactly what the
 * -2.5 series already produces, render byte-identically to the same payload
 * with no override at all: same readout string, same arc label, same boxes.
 * The provenance word describes the NUMBER on the board, not the payload that
 * produced it, and 107 is the VSEPR value whoever typed it. An override that
 * silently shifted a value it was supposed to match — or that flipped the
 * readout's provenance without changing a digit — is the defect this
 * parameter exists to avoid, so it is asserted at the RENDERED TREE in
 * molecule-struct/__tests__/angle-override.test.tsx rather than at the
 * arithmetic, where `override ?? table` would make it true by construction.
 *
 * WHAT validate() REFUSES, and why each refusal is a real payload:
 *
 *   a bare number             `angle_override: 117` — cannot express the two
 *                             angles of a TBP, so the form is refused rather
 *                             than half-honoured.
 *   an unknown key            `{ bond_angle: 117 }` — a typo that would
 *                             otherwise do nothing at all, silently.
 *   out of domain             below MIN_OVERRIDE_ANGLE or above 180: not a
 *                             bond angle at a single VSEPR centre.
 *   too far from its row      more than MAX_ANGLE_DEVIATION from the value
 *                             the row derives. A named exception is an
 *                             exception TO ITS ROW; a 40° gap means the
 *                             payload picked the wrong (bond_pairs,
 *                             lone_pairs), and reporting that is more useful
 *                             than drawing it.
 *   contradicts the DRAWING   the sharp one. The angle arc is drawn between
 *                             two specific sites of `bondSites` and labelled
 *                             with the reported angle, so the drawing makes a
 *                             qualitative claim the number must not
 *                             contradict: 2-0 and 2-3 draw their two bonds
 *                             COLLINEAR, and on those rows the only legal
 *                             override is exactly 180 — `{ bond: 104.5 }` on
 *                             XeF2 is refused. Every other row is drawn bent
 *                             and refuses 180.
 *
 *                             This does NOT derive the reported angle from
 *                             the drawing — nothing here ever does, in either
 *                             direction (see the section above). It is a
 *                             consistency VETO between two independently
 *                             authored columns: `drawnIsStraight` reads
 *                             `arc`, `bondAngle` is read from NCERT, and
 *                             physics.test.ts asserts the two agree across
 *                             all fourteen rows. A number that disagrees with
 *                             the picture the student is looking at is wrong
 *                             whichever of the two is at fault.
 *
 *   in coordination mode      that mode's readout is `ox / CN / EAN` and
 *                             prints no angle, so an override there would
 *                             move the arc label with no line on the board to
 *                             attribute it — a measured number with no
 *                             provenance beside it, which is exactly what
 *                             this parameter exists to prevent. Use
 *                             electron_domain or interaction, which print the
 *                             angle and its provenance together.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * THE READOUT SAYS WHERE ITS ANGLE CAME FROM — AND THE LINE IS FITTED
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * `VSEPR ideal` unless overridden; `measured` when it is. Without it a student
 * reads 117.5 off a board and has no way to know it is a model output rather
 * than a measurement, which is the whole complaint that produced this
 * parameter.
 *
 * IT DOES NOT FIT. The readout is one fitted line, `chrome.fitReadout`
 * truncates it, and at 343x236 the budget is
 *     maxChars(343 - 2*12, 14, latin) = floor(319 / (14*0.58)) = floor(39.28)
 *                                     = 39 characters
 * (at 495x270 it is floor(471/8.12) = 58, and at 900x430 floor(876/8.12) =
 * 107). The longest value string the table can already produce is
 *     `sp3d   trigonal bipyramidal   120° / 90°`  = 40 characters
 * which OVERFLOWS 39 TODAY: the checked-in pcl5.spec-small tree reads
 * `... 120° / 90` with the degree sign sliced off. Adding `   VSEPR ideal`
 * (14 more) to that line would slice the angle itself.
 *
 * So the line is built as a LADDER of rungs and the first that fits is used —
 * the provenance tag is never what gives, because it is the thing this change
 * exists to show:
 *
 *   1  hyb   shape   angles   TAG          `sp3   tetrahedral   109.5°   VSEPR ideal`
 *   2        shape   angles   TAG          the hybridisation goes first
 *   3        shape   angles   SHORT        `VSEPR` for `VSEPR ideal`
 *   4                angles   SHORT        the shape goes last
 *
 * THE HYBRIDISATION GOES FIRST because it is the one token on the line that is
 * exactly recoverable from another one — steric_number fixes it outright
 * (physics.test.ts asserts that: one hybridisation per steric number, no
 * exceptions) — and because `interaction` mode already ships without it, so
 * dropping it is a state this widget has always been able to be in.
 *
 * `measured` (8) is never abbreviated: it is already three characters shorter
 * than `VSEPR ideal` (11), so rung 3 has nothing to shorten on an overridden
 * line and collapses into rung 2.
 *
 * WHAT THAT COSTS, at 343x236 (39 chars), value strings only:
 *   every row but three keeps `shape   angles   VSEPR ideal` or better
 *   5-1 square pyramidal   `square pyramidal   89° / 180°`   29 + 14 = 43 > 39
 *                          -> rung 3, 29 + 8 = 37             short tag
 *   4-2 square planar      `square planar   90° / 180°`      26 + 14 = 40 > 39
 *                          -> rung 3, 26 + 8 = 34             short tag
 *   5-0 trigonal bipyr.    `trigonal bipyramidal   120° / 90°`
 *                          33 + 14 = 47 and 33 + 8 = 41, both > 39
 *                          -> rung 4, `120° / 90°   VSEPR` = 18   shape lost
 * and rung 4 fits at 343 for EVERY row, because the widest angle pair the
 * table holds is `87.5° / 175°` = 12 and 12 + 3 + 5 = 20 <= 39. The tag is
 * therefore never dropped at any board size this app checks — which is the
 * property that matters, since a line that silently loses its provenance on a
 * small phone is worse than one that never had it.

 *      THIS IS THE FIXTURE THAT PROVES `secondary_angle_deg` IS REAL. A TBP

 *      NOTE the angle here is the table's IDEALISED AX2E1 value
 *      (120 - 1x2.5), not a measured one for ozone. NCERT gives O3 as
 *      117 and SO2 as ~119, and this table is keyed on (bond_pairs,
 *      lone_pairs) alone, so it CANNOT tell the two apart -- one row
 *      serves both. The formal-charge citation below is exact; the
 *      angle is a model output and is quoted as such. THE ROW STAYS AT
 *      117.5: VSEPR cannot separate O3 from SO2, which is a property of
 *      the model NCERT teaches, not a defect in the table. A payload
 *      that KNOWS which species it is drawing may supply the measured
 *      angle through `angle_override` -- see the next section -- and the
 *      readout then stops calling it a VSEPR value. The table is never

 *        bond_pairs 2, lone_pairs 3 -> steric_number 5 -> sp3d
 *        shape LINEAR, bond_angle 180 EXACTLY.
 *      A naive "two bond pairs means bent, minus 2.5 per lone pair" gives
 *      120 - 7.5 = 112.5, or 180 - 7.5 = 172.5 — and both are wrong. The
 *      compression rule in reference 2 is a property of ONE parent geometry
 *      (sp3, where lone pairs and bond pairs compete for equivalent sites); in
 *      a trigonal bipyramid the three lone pairs all go EQUATORIAL and leave
 *      the two axial bonds exactly trans. A compression rule checked only
 *      against bent examples is a rule trusted for having been written, which
 *      is the failure mode docs/small-screen-rendering-rules.md names.
 *      Hence: the table below is a LOOKUP, not a formula. The -2.5 arithmetic
 *      appears only inside the three sp3 entries, where it is what NCERT
 *      measured.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * THE CAPS, and the arithmetic they come from.
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * Every number is measured at 343x236 — docs/small-screen-rendering-rules.md's
 * `spec-small`, the SMALLEST board this app checks — because a floor derived
 * at 900x430 is not a floor. They are enforced in `validate()`, never by
 * thinning the render.
 *
 * At LIGAND_SIZE 12 and verify-render's own 0.58 char-width model:
 *     one character       = 12 * 0.58  =  6.96 pt
 *     a 4-char label box  = 4 * 6.96   = 27.84 pt wide
 *     one text line       = 12 * 1.15  = 13.80 pt tall
 *
 * THE BOX. innerW = 343 - 2*PAD_SIDE(12) = 319.
 *          innerH = 236 - READOUT_BAND(28.4) - PAD_EDGE(10) = 197.6.
 *          centre = (12 + 319/2, 28.4 + 197.6/2) = (171.5, 127.2).
 *
 * THE SITE RADIUS. R = min(R_width, R_height) where
 *          R_width  = (319   - 2*27.84)/2 = 263.32/2 = 131.66
 *          R_height = (197.6 - 2*13.80)/2 = 170.00/2 =  85.00
 *   -> R = 85, HEIGHT-BOUND, which is what a landscape board should be.
 *
 * INTERACTION MODE reserves a legend row for the bond-style key, bandFor(12,6)
 * = 25.2pt, so its innerH is 172.4 and
 *          R_height = (172.4 - 27.6)/2 = 72.40   -> R = 72.4.
 *   Interaction mode is therefore the BINDING case for every label cap below.
 *
 * bond_pairs <= 6, and SEVEN IS A HARD ERROR.
 *   Six sites at 60 degrees apart put the tightest adjacent pair at
 *       dx = R*(1 - cos 60) = 0.5*R
 *   Two 4-char label boxes need 27.84 of centre-to-centre separation plus the
 *   4pt clearance verify-render's own glyph rule uses, i.e. 31.84.
 *       R = 85.0 (electron_domain):  dx = 42.50  vs 31.84  -> clears by 10.66
 *       R = 72.4 (interaction):      dx = 36.20  vs 31.84  -> clears by  4.36
 *   Seven sites at 51.43 degrees:
 *       dx = R*(1 - cos 51.43) = 0.3765*R
 *       R = 72.4 (interaction):      dx = 27.26  vs 31.84  -> FAILS by 4.58
 *       R = 85.0 (electron_domain):  dx = 32.00  vs 31.84  -> clears by 0.16
 *   0.16pt is not a margin, it is a coincidence, and it evaporates in the mode
 *   the widget is most likely to be used in. Independently: NCERT's VSEPR table
 *   covers 2 to 6 electron domains and stops there, so a seventh site has no
 *   row in the table to look up either. Capped at 6 in the schema.
 *
 * MAX_LIGAND_CHARS = 4, derived at the interaction-mode R with six sites:
 *       4 chars: 27.84 + 4 = 31.84 <= 36.20   OK
 *       5 chars: 34.80 + 4 = 38.80 >  36.20   FAILS
 *   A 5-char ligand at six sites is legible at 900x430 and illegible on a
 *   phone, which is precisely the case the schema must refuse rather than the
 *   render thin.
 *
 * MAX_CENTRE_CHARS = 3 is the DECLARED ceiling, measured conservatively; the
 *   effective one is 2, because the longest symbol in ELEMENTS is two
 *   characters and validate() refuses anything not in that table. Recorded
 *   because a cap nothing can reach is worth knowing about rather than
 *   silently trusting. At CENTRE_SIZE 16 a 3-char centre has half-width
 *   3*16*0.58/2 = 13.92, and
 *   the angle annotation sits at ANGLE_LABEL_R = 47 along the arc bisector. The
 *   binding pair is the seesaw/TBP bisector at 180 degrees, where the angle
 *   label shares the centre atom's y exactly:
 *       47 vs 13.92 + half("120.0°")=20.88  = 34.80   -> clears by 12.20
 *
 * THE GEOMETRIC BACKSTOP. The arithmetic above names the caps; it does not
 * enumerate every pair of labels a 14-entry shape table can produce. So
 * `fitProblems()` lays the payload out at REF_W x REF_H IN ITS OWN MODE and
 * runs verify-render's exact box-overlap test over every label the component
 * will emit — readout and legend included. validate() refuses anything it
 * reports. That is CLAUDE.md §3's "the schema's legal range must be a SUBSET
 * of what renders correctly", enforced constructively.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * THREE RENDERING TRAPS, all measured.
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * 1. A LONE PAIR DRAWN AS TWO <Circle>s IS A GUARANTEED HARD ERROR.
 *    verify-render assertion 8 fails any two circles of the same radius closer
 *    than 2r + 4. A lone pair is two dots about 6pt apart; at r = 2.4 the floor
 *    is 2(2.4) + 4 = 8.8 and 6.4 < 8.8, so EVERY payload carrying a lone pair
 *    would fail — NH3, H2O, SO2, XeF2, ozone, every amine and every alcohol.
 *    Both dots are therefore ONE <Path> with two closed polygon subpaths
 *    (`lonePairPath`). No arcs: verify-render's pathBounds pairs the numbers in
 *    `d` POSITIONALLY, so an `A` command's `rx ry rot laf sf` would be read as
 *    coordinates. Polygons and polylines only, everywhere in this file.
 *
 *    THE DESIGN RULE THAT FOLLOWS: at most ONE <Circle> of any given radius per
 *    render. This widget's Circle inventory is exactly one element —
 *    the highlight marker at r = MARKER_R (5). Nothing else in the tree is a
 *    Circle, so assertion 8 has no pair to compare and cannot fire.
 *
 * 2. INK COVERAGE FOR LINEAR SPECIES. CO2, BeCl2 and XeF2 drawn as two
 *    collinear bonds have a ZERO-HEIGHT bounding box. verify-render's boundsOf
 *    understands Path/Circle/Line/Rect and NOT text, so the whole diagram
 *    measures 0% of the board — assertion 2, a hard error. Two fixes, both
 *    needed:
 *      (a) `angleIsForced` returns true for every LINEAR shape, so the angle
 *          arc is always drawn for one; it is a semicircle of radius ARC_R and
 *          gives the molecule real 2D extent. Note this covers XeF2 (steric
 *          number 5, three lone pairs) as well as CO2 (steric number 2) —
 *          they are different rows of the table and the SAME drawn geometry,
 *          so keying the rule off "steric_number 2" alone would leave XeF2
 *          broken.
 *      (b) the component draws two full-width hairline rules bracketing the
 *          species band, which is what data_table_trend and reaction_scheme do
 *          for the same reason. Coverage at 343x236 is then 319*197.6/80948 =
 *          77.9% rather than a warn-band number.
 *
 * 3. BOND_GAP IS A DEVICE CONSTANT, NEVER A FRACTION OF R. The offset between
 *    the two lines of a double bond is 5 POINTS at every board size. Expressed
 *    as a fraction of R it would be, say, 0.06*R = 5.1pt at R = 85 and 4.3pt at
 *    the interaction-mode R = 72.4 — and 2.6pt at the 495x270 board's R if the
 *    legend grew — collapsing below 3pt and letting the second line drift into
 *    the ligand label. That is the identical defect class as field_lines' seed
 *    ring (docs/small-screen-rendering-rules.md): a chrome offset expressed as
 *    a world quantity. Every gap, inset, dot radius and font size in this file
 *    is in device points.
