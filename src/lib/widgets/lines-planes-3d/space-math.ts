/**
 * lines_planes_3d — closed-form 3-D affine geometry, the orthographic camera,
 * and the board layout. No React, no rendering.
 *
 * WHAT THIS WIDGET IS FOR. `content/concept-archetypes.csv` carries 17 rows at
 * `archetype_v2 == 'gap_3d_lines_planes'`. Twelve of them want ONE picture:
 * a point, a line r = a + λb, a plane n·r = d, and the perpendicular
 * relationships between them. This module is the maths behind that picture.
 * The other five want a cuboid, a tetrahedron, a planar parallelogram, a
 * 1-D division line and an octant reference figure — see this directory's
 * sibling note in the scoping report; they are NOT this widget.
 *
 * EVERY NUMBER IS CLOSED-FORM. Nothing here iterates, samples or solves
 * numerically. The formulas are the ones the Class 12 Ch 11 master reference
 * derives, and they are cross-checked in __tests__/independent-routes.test.ts
 * by DIFFERENT derivations — Heron's formula for the angle, volume-over-base
 * for the point–plane distance, a dense grid minimisation for the skew-line
 * distance, sign-change bisection for the line–plane intersection. A check
 * that rearranges the same equation catches nothing (CLAUDE.md §6).
 *
 * THE PROJECTION IS A PARAMETER, NOT A CONSTANT, AND THAT IS FORCED. A 3-D
 * figure on a 2-D board is a projection choice, and `lib/widgets/CLAUDE.md`
 * §"Exactly one WebView" forbids a second WebView, so a rotatable view is out
 * — this is SVG and the projection is static. But a single static projection
 * has a KERNEL: any line whose direction is parallel to the view direction
 * projects to a single point, and two distinct lines can project onto each
 * other. So `view` names one of three orthographic cameras with genuinely
 * different view directions, and `fitProblems` REFUSES a payload that
 * collapses under the chosen one, naming the views that would work.

 * normal parallel to their cross product — and the triple product with the
 * third view is the determinant above, which is not zero. So no plane is
 * edge-on in all three, and no line direction is parallel to more than one
 * view direction. There is ALWAYS a working view, and `fitProblems` names it
 * by checking rather than by assuming.
 *
 * THIS WAS NOT TRUE OF THE FIRST VERSION. `high` originally shared
 * `standard`'s azimuth of 25°, which put both view directions in one vertical
 * plane; any plane containing that plane was edge-on in both, and only
 * `swing` was a way out. The first draft of the edge-on test asserted `high`

       * the drawn extent may be built from nothing else.
       *
       * `|a2 − a1|` is NOT such a length, and an earlier version used it. It
       * is a property of the two base points the payload happened to name,
       * not of the lines: `r = a + λb` has infinitely many valid `a`, so
       * sliding `line2.at` ALONG ITS OWN LINE describes the identical pair of
       * lines while `|a2 − a1|` grows without bound. The picture drifted as it
       * grew and then stopped rendering entirely — at `at = (0,100,2)` the
       * bridge measured 4.2px and validate() refused a configuration it had
       * admitted at `at = (0,0,2)`, with `computeDerived` returning d = 2,
       * θ = 90 for both. Found by an independent verifier; the invariance test
       * that now guards it is "translating `at` along its own line".
       *
       * The consequence is worth stating because it fixes a second defect:
       * the drawn scene is now ~3.8d long and d across, so the bridge cannot
       * be an arbitrarily small fraction of the figure. A short bridge on the
       * board is therefore genuine foreshortening, which is what makes
       * `fitProblems`'s diagnosis of a short segment meaningful at all.
       *
       * When d = 0 the lines intersect and the configuration has NO length —
       * two intersecting lines are fixed up to similarity by θ alone. Any
       * constant works there, and the auto-fit cancels it: the scene is
       * symmetric about the crossing and scaling it changes no pixel.
       *
       * "d = 0" IS A RELATIVE TEST, AND `> 0` WAS NOT — the same defect as
       * `|a2 − a1|` above, one level down. `dist` is
       * |(a2−a1)·(b1×b2)|/|b1×b2|, so for lines that genuinely meet it lands
       * on exactly 0.0 only when the arithmetic happens to cancel exactly.
       * Slide `at` along its own line, or scale `dir` — the two freedoms that
       * describe the SAME pair of lines — and the cancellation stops being
       * exact: the reference `intersecting_lines` payload written as
       * `at: (5.7,−4.7,10.4)` instead of `(2,−1,3)` gives dist = 5.4e−16, so
       * `reach` became 1.0e−15, the projected extent hit `layout`'s 1e−9
       * clamp, the figure spanned 0.00px and validate() REFUSED a payload it
       * admits when the identical lines are written the other way (with
       * `computeDerived` returning θ 73.2°, d 0 for both). It also took the
       * bridge branch below, drawing and labelling a "d" of length 1e−16
       * while the readout printed `d 0` — the contradiction that branch's
       * else exists to prevent.
       *
       * `|a2 − a1|` appears here as a TOLERANCE and not as a length: it never
       * reaches a drawn coordinate, and it is the right yardstick precisely
       * because the rounding error in `dist` grows with the magnitudes fed to
       * the triple product. It is the same relative form as validate()'s own
       * degeneracy tests (`len(cross(b1,b2)) <= EPS·|b1|·|b2|`). One boolean
       * now drives both the reach and the bridge, so the two cannot disagree
       * about whether the lines meet.

 * Projects the scene, fits it to the plot box, and places every label.

 * THE FIT IS THE REASON THE CORNER SWEEP IS TRACTABLE. A payload carries up
 * to 16 numbers, i.e. 2^16 corners, which is not a set anyone enumerates.
 * Because the camera fits the projected bounding box to the plot box, the
 * absolute MAGNITUDE of every coordinate divides out — only the scene's
 * SHAPE reaches the board. So the corners that matter are shape corners
 * (near-parallel, near-perpendicular, near-degenerate under the projection),
 * a small enumerable set, and the magnitudes are covered by a scale-
 * invariance assertion instead of by a sweep. Both are in
 * __tests__/independent-routes.test.ts.
 *
 * WORLD CONSTANTS SCALE, CHROME CONSTANTS NEVER. `s` below is the only world
 * scale and it is derived from the measured box; every quantity taken from
 * `chrome` (label size, offsets, pads, marker radii) is in device points and
 * is NOT multiplied by a board dimension.

   * floors are written in the NaN-safe polarity now, but relying on the
   * polarity of six separate comparisons staying correct through future edits
