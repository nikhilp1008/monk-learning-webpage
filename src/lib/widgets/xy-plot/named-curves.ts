/**
 * xy_plot — NAMED CURVES: the shapes the book PRINTS, as opposed to the
 * shapes it defines.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE MECHANISM, AND SPECIFICALLY NOT `data` MODE.
 *
 * v2's `data` mode is a ONE-DIMENSIONAL STATISTICS SAMPLE. Its `values` key is
 * a list of observations, `derive` runs mean/median/variance over it, and the
 * component draws one bar per observation at integer positions 1..N. It has no
 * abscissa at all. Verified by reading `statistics`, `derive` and the `isData`
 * branch of `planFrame` before writing a line of this file, because "there is
 * already a data mode" is exactly the kind of thing that is true of the NAME
 * and false of the CODE. Feeding a stress-strain curve through it would
 * produce a bar chart with a mean line, and a readout saying `sd 41.7` about a
 * quantity that has no distribution.
 *
 * So `data` is left alone and this is its own mode. The two are different
 * objects that happen to both be "not a formula": one is a sample of a random
 * variable, the other is a printed shape.
 *
 * WHY NOT LET THE PAYLOAD CARRY THE POINTS. CLAUDE.md §3: the model never
 * emits coordinates. A model asked for "the stress-strain curve of a metal"
 * would emit a plausible polyline with the yield point in the wrong place, and
 * nothing downstream could tell. So the payload carries an IDENTIFIER — the
 * same contract `molecule_3d` uses for `pubchem:5957` — and the geometry lives
 * here, written once and reviewable once.
 *
 * WHERE A FORMULA EXISTS, THE POINTS ARE GENERATED FROM IT. There are TEN
 * shapes below and EIGHT of them (heating, titration, diode, solar cell,
 * potential energy, resonance, SHM energy, growth) have exact closed forms;
 * their control points are computed from the constants rather than eyeballed,
 * so the landmark that says "equivalence, pH 7" is at pH 7 because the
 * arithmetic put it there.
 *
 * The other two are not one kind. `binding_energy` is a MEASURED DATA TABLE —
 * B/A has no closed form, and the values are the measured ones, which is why
 * its own `source` says "plotted as data, because it IS data". Only
 * `stress_strain` is genuinely qualitative — NCERT Fig 9.3 prints no ordinate
 * values — and it says so in its own `source`.
 *
 * (This paragraph said "six of the nine" and then listed seven names, against
 * ten entries in `NAMED_CURVES`. Counted rather than reasoned from the
 * sentence: `NAMED_SHAPE_IDS.length` is 10.)
 *
 * NO AREA IS EVER REPORTED FOR A NAMED SHAPE, and that is deliberate rather
 * than unfinished. Several of these are polylines through a qualitative shape;
 * ∫ under a curve whose ordinate is "stress, illustrative" is a number with no
 * referent, and this widget's whole contract is that a number on the board is
 * exact. `derive` returns area 0 in `named` mode and the readout carries no
 * number at all — the same treatment `curve` mode gets, for the same reason.
 *
 * REFERENCE VALUES, each taken from NCERT or a standard table BEFORE any of
 * this was run:

 *                Physics XI Ch11). The melting plateau is therefore 334 kJ
 *                long and the boiling plateau 2260 kJ — a factor of 6.77,
 *                which is the single most important thing the figure teaches
 *                and the thing a hand-drawn version always gets wrong.
 *   titration    25.00 mL of 0.100 M HCl with 0.100 M NaOH. pH 1.000 at the
 *                start, 7.000 at 25.00 mL, 12.523 at 50.00 mL — all three
 *                from the dilution arithmetic, not from a figure.
 *   diode        Si, n = 2, V_T = 25.85 mV at 300 K. Knee near 0.7 V
 *                (NCERT Physics XII Ch14).
 *   solar cell   the same diode equation minus a photocurrent:
 *                I = I_L − I_S(e^{V/nV_T} − 1). I_sc = 40 mA, V_oc = 0.60 V.
 *   binding      B/A in MeV: ²H 1.11, ⁴He 7.07, ¹²C 7.68, ¹⁶O 7.98,

 *   resonance    a driven damped oscillator, A(ω) = (F₀/m) /
 *                √((ω₀²−ω²)² + (bω/m)²). At ω = ω₀ = 1 and b/m = 0.2 the
 *                amplitude is exactly 5.
 *   shm          E = ½kA², PE = ½kx², KE = ½k(A²−x²). PE + KE = E at every
