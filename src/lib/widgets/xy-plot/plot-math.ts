/**
 * xy_plot — closed-form curve evaluation, exact definite integrals, and
 * single-variable statistics. Every geometry function is a worklet: `shade_to`
 * is animatable, so the shaded region's path is rebuilt on the UI thread while
 * it sweeps.
 *
 * WHY A CLOSED SET OF CURVES rather than a list of points. CLAUDE.md §3's rule
 * is that the model never emits coordinates — it names a thing and fills its
 * parameters. So the payload says `parabola, a=1, b=0, c=0` and this module
 * computes both the curve AND the area under it analytically. A model that
 * sent 40 sampled points would be sending an approximation of an integral it
 * cannot do; this way the number on the board is exact by construction, and
 * the same function produces the readout and the drawing.
 *
 * Reference results (exact, verified against standard integrals):
 *   parabola  a=1,b=0,c=0   ∫₀² x² dx        = 8/3 = 2.666667
 *   line      a=1,c=0       ∫₀⁴ x dx         = 8
 *   sine      a=1,b=1,c=0   ∫₀^π sin x dx    = 2
 *   reciprocal a=1,c=0      ∫₁^e (1/x) dx    = 1
 *   exponential a=1,b=1,c=0 ∫₀¹ eˣ dx        = e − 1 = 1.718282
 *
 *   dataset [2,4,4,4,5,5,7,9] (the standard textbook set)
 *     mean = 5, median = 4.5, population variance = 4, σ = 2
 *
 * AREA BETWEEN TWO CURVES (v2). Derived from NCERT Class 12 Ch8 directly, not
 * read off any existing test:
 *   y = x and y = x² on [0,1]      ∫₀¹(x − x²)dx = 1/2 − 1/3   = 1/6
 *   y = a and y = u²/4a on [−2a,2a]  (the parabola y² = 4ax against its own
 *     latus rectum, drawn with the axes transposed — see the note on
 *     `areaBetween`)                                            = 8a²/3
 *   y = x and y = x² on [−1,2]     two INTERIOR crossings, 0 and 1:
 *     5/6 + 1/6 + 5/6                                           = 11/6
 *     — while |∫(x − x²)dx| over the same span is 3/2. The two differ, which
 *     is the whole reason the crossings are solved rather than ignored.
 *   y = x² and y = |x|             = 1/3, and NOT expressible as one payload:
 *     |x| is piecewise, so it takes two (each 1/6). See index.tsx's scope note.
 *     THAT IS NO LONGER TRUE AT v3 — `pieces` expresses |x| directly, and the
 *     one-payload answer is asserted at 1/3 in __tests__/piecewise.test.ts.
 *
 * v3 ADDS FOUR THINGS TO THIS MODULE, and one to a sibling.
 *
 *   1  INTEGRATION ALONG EITHER AXIS. Every geometry function below now works
 *      in (u, v) rather than (x, y): `u` is the integration variable and `v`
 *      is the value, and a single `swap` flag decides which PIXEL axis carries
 *      which. Nothing about the arithmetic changes — ∫f du is the same number
 *      whichever way the picture is drawn — so this is entirely a projection
 *      change, which is why it costs one boolean and no new integrals.
 *      v2 drew "the area bounded by y² = 4ax and its latus rectum" transposed
 *      and let the axis labels lie about which variable was which (see the
 *      note on `areaBetween`, which is now historical). At v3 the labels tell
 *      the truth: `integrate_along: 'y'` puts u on the vertical axis, the
 *      strips run horizontally, and `x_label`/`y_label` still name the
 *      horizontal and vertical axes respectively.
 *
 *   2  PIECEWISE f. `CurvePiece[]` — (from, to, kind, coefficients) — with
 *      the crossing search run PER PIECE and the readout summing pieces.
 *      Modulus is the two-piece case and is exactly why it exists.
 *
 *   3  THE EXACT DERIVATIVE, and a tangent or normal built from it.
 *
 *   4  A FAMILY of one curve at several values of one coefficient. No new
 *      maths at all — it is `curvePath` called N times — but it is listed
 *      because the CAP on N is a maths-adjacent decision (see index.tsx).
 *
 * The fifth v3 capability, NAMED CURVES, is deliberately NOT here: see
 * ./named-curves.ts and its header for why a shape the book prints without a
 * formula is a different kind of object from everything in this file.
 *
 * v3 REFERENCE RESULTS, each derived from NCERT before being compared to any
 * output of this module:
 *
 *   |x| against x² on [−1,1]   ONE payload now: pieces [(−1,0) line a=−1],
 *     [(0,1) line a=1] against parabola a=1. 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3.
 *   ∫₀² |x − 1| dx             pieces [(0,1) line a=−1 c=1], [(1,2) line a=1
 *     c=−1]. Each triangle is 1/2, so the total is 1 — and the SIGNED
 *     integral of the same two pieces is also 1, because both pieces are
 *     above the axis. The case that separates them is below.
 *   ∫₀² (x − 1) dx             = 0 signed, 1 unsigned. Same breakpoint, and
 *     the two numbers differ, which is what makes `area` and `area_between`
 *     genuinely different questions on a piecewise payload.
 *   d/dx (x²) at x = 3         = 6. The tangent there is y = 6x − 9, and the
 *     area between x² and that tangent on [3−h, 3+h] is 2h³/3 exactly — an
 *     identity that does NOT go through the derivative formula, so it is a
 *     real check on it rather than a restatement.
 *   y² = 4ax and x = a         8a²/3, now drawn the way the book draws it,
 *     with y vertical: `integrate_along: 'y'`, u ∈ [−2a, 2a], f(u) = a (the
 *     latus rectum) against g(u) = u²/4a (the parabola).

 * nowhere else. A device-point floor against a shrinking frame, exactly as
 * the frame rule predicts, and invisible at 495x270 and 900x430.
 *

 * than a hope, and eight labels down a 164.4pt plot are 23.5pt apart.

 *
 *   swap = false   u horizontal, v vertical.   The v1/v2 picture, unchanged.
 *   swap = true    u VERTICAL, v horizontal.   Strips run horizontally, so
 *                  "area by integration along the y-axis" is the same
 *                  integral drawn the way the book draws it.
 *
 * Each axis is (origin at its own MINIMUM) + (offset) x (signed scale), and
 * the sign is what lets one formula serve both orientations. When u is
 * horizontal `uOrigin` is the left edge and `uScale` is +plotW/span; when u is
 * vertical `uOrigin` is the BOTTOM edge and `uScale` is −plotH/span, because a
 * vertical u must increase upward while pixel y increases downward. `vScale`
 * is the mirror. index.tsx's `planFrame` is the one place those six numbers

 * WHY "origin at the minimum" AND NOT "origin at v = 0", which is the shorter

 * `...134`. Nine golden trees failed on that difference alone. So there is
 * ONE spelling, it is this one, and it is the one the ticks were frozen at.
