 * A comparison table has NO trend and NO ordering: swapping two columns
 * changes nothing about what it says. That is why it is not
 * `data_table_trend` with strings switched on — that widget right-aligns and
 * uses tabular figures precisely because its column IS a trend, and one
 * widget whose layout rules contradict themselves depending on a flag picks
 * the wrong one the first time they disagree.
 *
 * THE CAPS ARE A PRE-FILTER, NOT THE GATE. `reaction_scheme` taught that: its
 * character caps were raised 10 -> 20 and only 2 of 38 stored payloads moved,
 * because the real limit was the measured width check. So `fits()` below
 * measures the laid-out table and refuses with the measurement in the string,
 * and the character caps only stop the obviously-too-long before it gets that
 * far.
