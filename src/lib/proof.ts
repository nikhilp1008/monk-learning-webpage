 * difference between two snapshots.
 *
 * Three things are stored locally and nothing else:
 *  - the last snapshot, so a later fetch has something to compare against;
 *  - the ids of events already shown, so a moment never fires twice;
 *  - whether a class has ever been taken, which is the one fact `/progress`
 *    does not carry (the ledger counts doubts and questions, not classes).
 *
 * The *collection* of milestones is deliberately not stored: it is derivable
 * from the current payload at any time (`chapters_strong: 3` means three
 * chapter milestones exist), which keeps it correct across reinstalls and
 * devices. Only "have I already celebrated this" is local state.
