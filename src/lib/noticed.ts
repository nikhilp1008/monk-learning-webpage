 * causal advice we cannot support ("a class will fix this faster"). What is
 * left is the one thing no competitor can say, because it needs concept-level
 * mastery: what is actually true about this student's syllabus right now.
 *
 * Templated, not generated. MOMENTS.md's open question was whether the tutor
 * model should write these; templates won for v1 because they are free,
 * offline, instant, and cannot drift into a claim we did not intend. The cost
 * is a fixed vocabulary, which is the right trade while the copy is still
 * being learned from.

 * true and useful can be said, and the card then does not render at all.
