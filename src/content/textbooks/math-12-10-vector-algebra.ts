/**
 * Chapter 10 · Vector Algebra. Mathematics, Class 12.
 *
 * Restructured from pages 601 to 647 of the Drona Class 12 Mathematics Master
 * Reference into the block system in design_handoff_textbooks/CONTENT_SPEC.md,
 * following math-12-01-relations.ts for voice, density and file shape.
 *
 * The source is two documents stacked: a typeset chapter of three subtopics
 * (01 vector operations and components, pages 601 to 610; 02 product of two
 * vectors, 611 to 618; 03 product of three vectors, 619 to 626) and a Round 2
 * Addendum of five inserts (A oblique resolution and angle bisectors, B
 * magnitude algebra and constraint problems, C nested cross products and
 * vector equations, D position-vector triangle geometry, P a previous-year
 * analysis), pages 627 to 647.
 *
 * SIX TOPICS, and the folding that produced them:
 *
 *   - Subtopic 01 is split in two. Naming a vector (magnitude, unit vector,
 *     position vector, head minus tail, direction cosines and ratios) is a
 *     different skill from combining two of them (addition, the section
 *     formula, collinearity), and the source's own pitfalls list splits along
 *     the same seam. Topics 01 and 02.
 *   - Subtopic 02 is split in two, one product each. Together they are the
 *     highest-yield block in the chapter and the source gives them eight
 *     pages; one topic would have been thirty blocks of two unrelated
 *     definitions. Topics 03 and 04.
 *   - Subtopic 03 is split in two, scalar triple product and vector triple
 *     product. The source itself says this block is 84 of the roughly 135
 *     items in its previous-year bank, which is more than the other two blocks
 *     combined. Topics 05 and 06.
 *   - Addendum A1 (splitting a vector parallel and perpendicular to another)
 *     and A3 (angle bisectors) fold into Topic 03, because both are the
 *     projection formula applied once more. A2 (coordinates in a
 *     non-orthogonal basis) folds into Topic 05, since it is Cramer's rule
 *     written with box products.
 *   - Addendum B folds in two pieces. B1, B2 and B4 (squaring a magnitude, the
 *     parallelogram law, the diagonal dictionary, the constraint strategy) are
 *     pure dot-product algebra and sit in Topic 03. B3 (Cauchy-Schwarz and the
 *     triangle inequality) sits in Topic 04 next to Lagrange's identity, which
 *     is what the source derives it from.
 *   - Addendum C folds into Topic 06 whole: C1 the cross of two cross
 *     products, C2 solving a cross x = b, C4 the plane-intersection direction.
 *     C3, the squared box product, sits in Topic 05 instead, because its
 *     payoff is the reciprocal system, which is scalar-triple-product
 *     material.
 *   - Addendum D folds into Topic 02: incentre, the circumcentre and
 *     orthocentre identity with its Euler line, and the area ratios that read
 *     straight off a section-formula coefficient.
 *   - Addendum P is not a topic. Its question distribution feeds the hook, its
 *     five archetypes feed worked examples and procedures, and its ten
 *     engineered traps feed the `mistakes` cards.
 *
 * WHAT CLASS 11 ALREADY OWNS, quoted rather than retaught. math-11-11-three-d.ts
 * teaches coordinates in space, the octants, the distance formula and the
 * section formula in coordinates, including the external case and the
 * collinearity test by ratio. So Topic 01 quotes the distance formula as the
 * magnitude formula it already is, and Topic 02 states the section formula in
 * position vectors and spends its length on the two things Class 11 cannot do:
 * proving it in one line, and using it to reach the centroid, the incentre,
 * the orthocentre and an area ratio. The Class 11 chapter also draws a point
 * marching along a segment as the ratio changes, so this chapter does not draw
 * that figure again.
 *
 * NOTATION, settled early and used everywhere:
 *
 *   - A vector is a single italic letter with no arrow over it: <i>a</i>, and
 *     its magnitude is |<i>a</i>|. The renderer has no combining-arrow glyph
 *     and Georgia would have to fall back for one, so an arrow would be a
 *     rendering gamble on the most common token in the chapter. Instead every
 *     block that introduces a letter says whether it is a vector, and the
 *     scalar side lengths in the incentre formula are named <i>p</i>, <i>q</i>,
 *     <i>s</i> rather than the source's a, b, c precisely so that no letter
 *     ever means a vector and a number in the same sentence, and the point of
 *     an area-ratio question keeps the full <i>OP</i> spelling for the same
 *     reason.
 *   - Unit vectors along the axes are î, ĵ and k̂. î (U+00EE) and ĵ (U+0135)
 *     are precomposed and safe in any WGL4 font; k̂ has no precomposed form in
 *     Unicode and is k followed by U+0302 COMBINING CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT. Same
 *     for n̂ and b̂. â (U+00E2) is precomposed. Checked: none of these fall in
 *     the validator's emoji ranges.
 *   - Dot product is · (U+00B7), cross product is × (U+00D7), both already
 *     carrying thousands of uses across the shipped chapters. Perpendicular is
 *     ⊥ and parallel is ∥, both already in use, and both are spelled out in
 *     words on first appearance in each topic.
 *   - Scalar triple product is [<i>a b c</i>].
 *   - Every <sup> and <sub> in this file was walked against the SUPERS and
 *     SUBS tables in components/textbook/markup.tsx: only digits, the minus
 *     sign and parentheses appear, so nothing degrades to small baseline text.
 *   - Diagram labels go into SVG text, not the markup renderer, so they carry
 *     no hats and no combining marks at all: a, b, c, a × b, P, O.
 *
 * SEVEN `diagram` blocks, four `axes3d` and three `plot`, one per topic except
 * Topic 03 which gets two. Each is a picture the source explicitly asks for.
 *
 *   1. Topic 01, axes3d: a vector, its shadow on the floor, its box and its
 *      three components. The source's own anchor is "go 3 blocks east, 2
 *      north, 1 up", which is a box, and axes3d already draws exactly that.
 *   2. Topic 02, plot: the triangle law, the parallelogram law and a − b. Flat
 *      on purpose. Two vectors always span a plane, so an isometric frame
 *      would foreshorten a picture that has no third dimension in it.
 *   3. Topic 03, plot: the projection of a on b at an acute angle, a right
 *      angle and an obtuse angle. Also flat, for the same reason, and the sign
 *      of the projection is the whole point, which needs the drop to be
 *      visibly on one side of the origin or the other.
 *   4. Topic 03, plot: a parallelogram's two diagonals, then the rectangle and
 *      the rhombus cases of Addendum B2. Flat, and the equal-length and
 *      right-angle facts are only readable when they are not foreshortened.
 *   5. Topic 04, axes3d: a and b, then a × b, then b × a flipped, then the
 *      parallelogram whose area is |a × b|. Genuinely three-dimensional: the
 *      product leaves the plane of the two vectors, which is the one thing a
 *      flat figure cannot show. a and b are placed in the plane x = 0 so their
 *      cross product lies along the drawn x-axis and can be read off it.
 *   6. Topic 05, axes3d: three edges, the base, the normal over the base, then
 *      all twelve edges of the parallelepiped. A box is a box; no 2D figure
 *      draws a volume.
 *   7. Topic 06, axes3d: b and c, then b × c leaving their plane, then
 *      a × (b × c) landing back in it. The claim being drawn is about which
 *      plane a vector lives in, so the figure must have a plane and a way out
 *      of it. b and c again sit in x = 0, so "back in the plane" is visible as
 *      "back to x = 0".
 *
 * Every axes3d coordinate was placed by hand against the isometric map in
 * components/textbook/figures.tsx so that the arrowhead and its label land
 * inside the drawn canvas.
 *
 * ERRATA CHECKED. The book's errata, source pages 830 to 832, lists five
 * entries: Chapter 1 pages 14 and 43, Chapter 3 page 153, Chapter 11 pages 678
 * and 693. All five are production clipping rather than mathematics. There is
 * no entry for Chapter 10, and the page range 601 to 647 is not named anywhere
 * in the errata. Confirmed by reading all three errata pages, not assumed.
 *
 * CORRECTIONS BEYOND THE ERRATA, found by re-solving every computation in the
 * range. The corrected value is what this chapter teaches; the printed one is
 * never reproduced.
 *
 *   1. Page 630, Example A.3, the external-bisector check. For
 *      a = î + 2ĵ + 2k̂ and b = 2î + ĵ − 2k̂ the book gets the external bisector
 *      direction right, (−î + ĵ + 4k̂)/(3√2), and then prints
 *      "b̂ext · â = (−1 + 2 − 8)/(9√2) = −7/(9√2)" and
 *      "b̂ext · b̂ = (−2 + 1 + 8)/(9√2) = 7/(9√2)".
 *      Both third terms carry the wrong sign: 4 × 2 = +8, not −8, and
 *      4 × (−2) = −8, not +8. The correct values are
 *      b̂ext · â = (−1 + 2 + 8)/(9√2) = 9/(9√2) = 1/√2 and
 *      b̂ext · b̂ = (−2 + 1 − 8)/(9√2) = −9/(9√2) = −1/√2.
 *      Three independent checks. First, â · b̂ = (2 + 2 − 4)/9 = 0, so a and b
 *      are perpendicular here, the external bisector is at 45° to â and 135°
 *      to b̂, and the two cosines must be ±1/√2 = ±0.707, not ±0.550.
 *      Second, in general (â − b̂) · â = 1 − â · b̂ ≥ 0 always, so the first dot
 *      product can never be the negative one; the book has the two signs the
 *      wrong way round as well as the wrong size. Third, the book's own
 *      internal check on the same page gives b̂int · â = b̂int · b̂ = 1/√2, which
 *      is the 45° the perpendicularity forces.
 *      The book's narrative conclusion, "equal magnitude, opposite sign",
 *      survives, because the identical slip was made twice in mirror image.
 *      This chapter works the example with the correct numbers.
 *   2. Page 639, Addendum D4, the area-ratio derivation. Printed:
 *      "b − p = [l(a − b) + n(c − b)]/L" and "c − p = [l(a − c) + m(b − c)]/L".
 *      Both are the negatives of what they are labelled. Expanding,
 *      Lb − (la + mb + nc) = l(b − a) + n(b − c), so the printed right-hand
 *      side is p − b, not b − p, and likewise for the second. The final ratio
 *      l/L is unaffected, because both factors were negated and the two
 *      minus signs cancel in the cross product. Corrected silently in Topic
 *      02's derivation, which writes the two edge vectors the way round its
 *      labels claim.
 *   3. Page 642, Addendum P.2, the distribution table. The three blocks are
 *      printed as "~20% (≈21 items)", "~35% (≈30 items)" and "~45% (≈84
 *      items)" out of "roughly 135 items". The counts are self-consistent,
 *      21 + 30 + 84 = 135, and page 647 leans on the 84 again by name. The
 *      percentages are not: 21/135 is 16%, 30/135 is 22%, 84/135 is 62%. The
 *      printed percentages happen to sum to 100 but do not describe these
 *      counts, and they badly understate how triple-product-heavy the bank
 *      is. The hook quotes the counts, which the book corroborates twice,
 *      and not the percentages.
 *
 * One smaller slip, not worth a correction note in the copy but recorded here.
 * Page 617, Subtopic 02, MCQ Q1 distractor (c) says that θ = 60° is "the
 * answer if one wrongly set cos θ = √3 sin θ". That substitution gives
 * tan θ = 1/√3 and θ = 30°, not 60°; the misreading that produces 60° is
 * sin θ = √3 cos θ. The MCQ in Topic 04 uses the honest version of the trap.
 *
 * PDF EXTRACTION DAMAGE, distinguished from error and re-authored rather than
 * guessed. The extractor renders the ratio colon as "{nC", the minus sign as
 * "{n7", the dot product as "{nA" and the cross product as "{nN" wherever the
 * source uses its display maths font, which affects the section formula on
 * page 604, all of Subtopic 03's Section 1, and Practice 4 on page 624. Every
 * one of those was reconstructed from the surrounding algebra and re-solved
 * from scratch: the external section formula is (m·b − n·a)/(m − n), and
 * Practice 4's answer, printed as the orphaned fragment "15̂+15̂−15̂" at the
 * foot of the page with its hats and axes stripped, is 15î + 15ĵ − 15k̂, which
 * this chapter's Topic 06 Example 1 re-derives.
 *
 * The exam hook is authored once, on topic 1, with a bold heading per topic,
 * because the reader renders `hook` only there. Diagram chips and captions are
 * plain text and carry no inline tags.

          "html": "<b>01 · Vectors, Components and Direction Cosines</b><br>The foundation block, and a guaranteed scorer. CBSE Boards carry a 1 to 2 mark definition, a unit vector or a magnitude in almost every paper. JEE Main reliably asks 1 to 2 questions a year on unit vectors and on direction cosines and direction ratios. CUET loves the direct plug-in. JEE Advanced rarely tests this head-on, but every collinearity and coplanarity setup in the paper is built on top of it, so get it airtight and the rest of the chapter rests on solid ground.<br><br><b>02 · Addition, the Section Formula and Triangle Geometry</b><br>CBSE sets a short section-formula or midpoint problem most years, and a 3 to 5 mark position-vector proof about a triangle is a standing favourite. JEE Main asks a fast section-formula numeric. JEE Advanced ran 4 to 8 mark cevian proofs through the whole of 1988 to 2001, and their modern descendant is a one-line ratio question, so the method is still worth owning.<br><br><b>03 · The Dot Product: Angle, Projection and Magnitude Algebra</b><br>Half of the highest-yield subtopic in the chapter. CBSE routinely sets 2 to 3 marks on the scalar product or a projection. JEE Main asks projections more often than any other single idea in the chapter, across more sessions than any other. JEE Advanced does not ask for a projection, it asks you to square a magnitude, expand, and notice that the unknowns are dot products.<br><br><b>04 · The Cross Product: Area and the Perpendicular Direction</b><br>The other half. CBSE asks for the area of a triangle or parallelogram. JEE Main asks for a vector of given magnitude perpendicular to two others, or for an angle from mixed dot and cross data. The trap planted most often in this whole chapter lives here: a dot product of zero means perpendicular, a cross product of zero means parallel, and swapping them costs the question.<br><br><b>05 · The Scalar Triple Product: Volume and Coplanarity</b><br>Pure JEE territory, and the largest block in the bank by a distance. Coplanarity with a parameter is the single most repeated question shape the source records, running from 1985 to 2020. Volumes of a parallelepiped or a tetrahedron are close behind. The rationalised CBSE syllabus no longer tests this directly, so treat it as your JEE edge.<br><br><b>06 · The Vector Triple Product and Vector Equations</b><br>A JEE Advanced signature. The BAC minus CAB identity is a recurring tool, and the equations it solves, where the unknown is a vector rather than a number, are the shape Advanced likes best because a careless student never notices the whole line of solutions. The source's own previous-year bank runs to about 135 items from 1978 to 2020: 21 on position-vector geometry, 30 on the two products, and 84 on the triple products and their applications."
