/**
 * Chapter 02 · Relations and Functions, Mathematics, Class 11.
 *
 * Restructured from the Drona Class 11 Mathematics Master Reference (pages 77
 * to 143) into the block system in design_handoff_textbooks/CONTENT_SPEC.md,
 * matching the voice and density of math-11-01-sets.ts.
 *
 * Three editorial decisions worth recording:
 *
 * 1. The source is three documents stacked: Subtopics 01–03, a Round 1
 *    Supplement (Subtopic 04 on types of relations, plus Procedure E on finding
 *    a range appended to Subtopic 03), and a Round 2 Addendum of six toolkit
 *    items (F vertical line test, G composition, H parity, I periodicity,
 *    J graph transformations, K functional equations). The addenda are written
 *    as inserts into existing subtopics, not as topics of their own, so they
 *    are folded in the same way: F and J into the Functions topic, G into the
 *    domain and range topic alongside Procedure E, and H, I and K into a
 *    closing topic on symmetry, periodicity and functional equations. Six
 *    topics, the spec's maximum, is what it takes to hold that much material
 *    without any one topic running past a sitting.
 *
 * 2. The hook is merged, exactly as in Chapter 01. The source carries an "Exam
 *    Relevance" panel per subtopic, but the reader renders `hook` on topic 1
 *    only, so all six are gathered into that single accordion under their own
 *    topic headings rather than thrown away.
 *
 * 3. Five `diagram` blocks, all of them authored figures rather than the six
 *    bespoke set-theory kinds, which describe nothing in this chapter. Four are
 *    `plot` and one is `numberline`, and each one replaces a figure the source
 *    itself asks for: the product as a grid of points, a relation as a
 *    highlighted slice of that grid, the standard function graphs (with the
 *    circle alongside them as the thing that fails the vertical line test), the
 *    natural domain assembled on the real line, and the parity and periodicity
 *    pictures. Everything drawn is in the closed curve vocabulary; nothing here
 *    needs a kind the reader does not have.
 *
 * One-one, onto, bijective and inverse functions are deliberately absent: the
 * source defers them to the Class 12 treatment and says so explicitly.

CBSE Boards lifts 1–2 mark direct questions straight from here: write <i>A</i> × <i>B</i>, or recover <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> from <i>A</i> × <i>B</i>. JEE Main asks fast counting questions on <i>n</i>(<i>A</i> × <i>B</i>) and on the number of subsets. JEE Advanced rarely asks it in isolation but builds every later idea, relations, functions, domains, graphs, on this single definition. Master it now and the rest of the chapter becomes bookkeeping.<br><br><b>02 · Relations: Domain, Range and Counting</b><br>Pure-volume territory for CBSE Boards. Almost every year carries a 1–2 mark question on writing a relation in roster form or stating its domain and range, plus the count 2<sup>pq</sup>. JEE Main turns that counting into quick objective questions, usually with a few pairs forced in or out.<br><br><b>03 · Types of Relations and Equivalence Classes</b><br>CBSE examines this formally in Class 12 Chapter 1, where <b>“show that R is an equivalence relation”</b> is a standing 3–5 mark question and “find the equivalence class of…” is its usual follow-up, so every hour here is a mark banked twice. JEE Main asks it two ways: a one-line property check, and a pure count such as the number of reflexive relations on a 5-element set. JEE Advanced pushes into classes as a partition.<br><br><b>04 · Functions, the Standard Zoo and Graph Moves</b><br>A guaranteed scorer. CBSE lifts direct 1–3 mark questions on “is this a function?”, on domain and range, and on the standard definitions and graphs. JEE Main loves the counting fact <b><i>q</i><sup>p</sup></b>. The graph transformations are never re-taught anywhere: a question like “how many real solutions has |<i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)| = <i>k</i>” is a horizontal line sliding over a folded graph, and it collapses to a glance.<br><br><b>05 · Domain, Range and the Algebra of Real Functions</b><br>Domain-finding for radicals and rational expressions is close to guaranteed in JEE Main, and range questions carry the discriminant method. Domains of composites are examined at Class 11 level. Almost every mark here rides on <b>one bracket</b>, square or round, so the endpoint check is the habit to build.<br><br><b>06 · Symmetry, Periodicity and Functional Equations</b><br>The toolkit layer JEE builds on top of this chapter and never re-teaches, assumed knowledge by the time Limits, Continuity and Definite Integrals arrive. Parity halves the work in every range and sketching problem. The fractional part {<i>x</i>} is the purest periodic function on the syllabus and is tested constantly. Functional equations look formidable and reduce to three techniques."
