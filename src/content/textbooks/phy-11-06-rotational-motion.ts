/**
 * Chapter 06 · Rotational Motion. Physics, Class 11.
 *
 * Restructured from pages 356 to 447 of the Drona Class 11 Physics Master
 * Reference (Chapter 6, which the book titles "System of Particles and
 * Rotational Motion"; the catalogue this reader matches on calls it
 * "Rotational Motion") into the block system in
 * design_handoff_textbooks/CONTENT_SPEC.md and lib/textbooks.ts, matching the
 * voice and density of phy-11-02-motion-straight-line.ts.
 *
 * SIX TOPICS FROM SEVEN SOURCE SUB-TOPICS, WITH ONE MERGE AND ONE PREAMBLE
 * FOLDED IN. The source runs a preamble ("Chapter Foundations: Rigid Bodies &
 * Types of Motion", pages 356 to 359) and then seven sub-topics: Center of
 * Mass (360-370), Vector Product of Two Vectors (371-377), Torque and Angular
 * Momentum (378-388), Equilibrium of a Rigid Body (389-398), Moment of Inertia
 * (399-409), Rotational Kinematics and Dynamics (410-420), Rolling Motion
 * (421-431). Two of those nine units are not topics here:
 *
 *   - The Foundations preamble has no Sections 1 to 8, no worked example, no
 *     MCQ and no practice set, and its own Exam Relevance line says it is
 *     "rarely asked as standalone questions". It is a preamble, not a
 *     sub-topic, so it opens Topic 01 as prose plus Figure 6.1 rather than
 *     becoming a thin seventh topic.
 *   - Vector Product is merged into Torque and Angular Momentum as Topic 02.
 *     This is the source's own framing, not a merge to hit a number: the
 *     Vector Product Exam Relevance line reads "The cross product is the
 *     mathematical engine behind torque and angular momentum", and every
 *     result in it (the determinant, the right-hand rule, the sin factor,
 *     A x A = 0) exists in this chapter only to be spent on tau = r x F and
 *     L = r x p, which arrive seven pages later. Teaching the tool and its one
 *     application together is what lets Topic 02 open on a door hinge instead
 *     of on a determinant.
 *
 * The remaining five sub-topics map 1:1 onto Topics 03 to 06 plus Topic 01's
 * second half. Nothing else was merged or split. Six is also the ceiling
 * scripts/validate-chapters.mjs enforces, and seven topics would have failed
 * that gate outright.
 *
 * CUT: HOW 92 PAGES BECAME 154 BLOCKS. This is the largest chapter in the
 * wave and roughly 60% more source than the pilot's 57 pages, so selection,
 * not compression, did the work:
 *
 *   - The linear-to-angular correspondence is carried ONCE, by the eight-row
 *     defgrid in Topic 01 ("Every linear quantity and its angular twin"), and
 *     never re-tabulated. The source prints the same dictionary twice, in the
 *     Foundations roadmap and again as the "master analogy table" in
 *     Rotational Kinematics; Topic 05 quotes it instead of repeating it, which
 *     is what freed the space for that topic's connected-body material.
 *   - Prose is spent almost entirely on the places the analogy BREAKS, which
 *     is the brief's organising idea and also where the marks are: that I
 *     depends on the axis and so has no single value (Topic 04's opening and
 *     its `def`), that torque is a cross product and therefore has a direction
 *     and a sign (Topic 02's `def` and its sign convention), and that rolling
 *     couples v to omega so the two motions stop being independent (Topic
 *     06). Where the analogy simply works, a defgrid row does the job of a
 *     paragraph.
 *   - The Round 2 Addendum (pages 432 to 447, six addenda A to F, 16 pages) is
 *     explicitly not a topic per the brief. Every line drawn from it below is
 *     confined to a `protip`, a `mistakes` item, or the hardest `ex`/`mcq` in
 *     the group it extends: Addendum A (velocity of every point on a rolling
 *     body) into Topic 06's `ex` 4 and its snapshot line, Addendum B (massive
 *     pulleys, two unequal tensions) into Topic 05's `protip` and `mistakes`,
 *     Addendum C (slipping into rolling: time, distance, heat) into Topic 06's
 *     `protip` and one `mcq`, Addendum F (over a step) into Topic 03's
 *     `protip`. No `formula`, `defgrid`, `deriv` or `proc` block below is
 *     sourced from the addendum. Addenda D (centre of percussion) and E (the
 *     physical pendulum) are used for a single `mistakes` line each and
 *     nothing more: D because its master collision formula is wrong (see
 *     CORRECTIONS below) and E because the physical pendulum is oscillation,
 *     which this chapter does not teach.
 *   - Four whole source passages were dropped rather than thinned: the
 *     algebraic proof that A x B is perpendicular to A (page 373, a
 *     term-by-term cancellation that teaches nothing a student can reuse), the
 *     tan(theta) = |A x B| / (A . B) angle formula (page 373, not on any
 *     syllabus this chapter serves), the experimental plumb-line location of
 *     the centre of gravity (page 393), and the tensor remark about moment of
 *     inertia (page 400, explicitly out of syllabus in its own sentence).
 *
 * ERRATA REVIEWED (source pages 977 to 981, all five pages read in full; the
 * list covers eight chapters). TWO entries touch this range, and both are
 * real defects in this chapter, not formatting:
 *
 *   - Page 979, "Crack the MCQ (metre stick balance problem): none of the
 *     printed options match the worked solution". The Equilibrium sub-topic's
 *     MCQ Q4 (source page 397) derives m = 0.28 kg correctly by moments about
 *     the 40 cm pivot, then keys "Correct: (B)" where (B) is 0.10 kg; the four
 *     printed options are 0.20, 0.10, 0.30 and 0.15 kg and none is 0.28 kg.
 *     The errata calls the question flawed as posed and leaves the repair to a
 *     human. Repaired here: Topic 03's fourth MCQ keeps the pedagogical point
 *     the source was after (an off-centre pivot makes the stick's own weight
 *     matter) but is re-posed with a 0.20 kg mass at the 10 cm mark instead of
 *     0.50 kg. Moments about the 40 cm pivot then read 0.20 x 0.30 =
 *     0.10 x 0.10 + m x 0.50, so m = 0.10 kg exactly, which IS one of the four
 *     printed options; and the weightless-stick trap now lands on a clean
 *     0.12 kg, offered as a distractor with its own nudge. The full working is
 *     in that block's `solution`.
 *   - Page 979, "Practice answer 4 (angular momentum of a particle): mass
 *     factor dropped". The Torque sub-topic's practice Q4 (source page 386)
 *     prints L = −5 k kg m^2/s where the correct value is −10 k kg m^2/s; the
 *     printed number is r x v with the 2 kg mass never applied. Independently
 *     recomputed here before reading the errata (r x v has z-component
 *     (3)(−1) − (1)(2) = −5, and L = m(r x v) = 2(−5) = −10) and carried into
 *     Topic 02's practice set with the mass factor in place and the trap named
 *     in the answer.
 *
 * CORRECTIONS BEYOND THE ERRATA. Every worked example, practice answer and
 * MCQ key in the range was recomputed independently. Three defects the errata
 * does not list:
 *
 *   1. Moment of Inertia, practice answer 4 (source page 407). Printed:
 *      "I = 5/6 MR^2 (where M is the remaining mass)" for a uniform disc of
 *      radius R with a CONCENTRIC hole of radius R/2 removed. Correct:
 *      I = 5/8 MR^2. Working, with sigma the surface density: the full disc
 *      has mass sigma.pi.R^2 and I = (1/2)sigma.pi.R^4; the removed core has
 *      mass sigma.pi.R^2/4 and I = (1/2)(sigma.pi.R^2/4)(R/2)^2 =
 *      sigma.pi.R^4/32; so the annulus has I = sigma.pi.R^4(16 − 1)/32 =
 *      15 sigma.pi.R^4/32 and mass M = (3/4)sigma.pi.R^2, whence
 *      sigma.pi.R^2 = 4M/3 and I = (15/32)(4M/3)R^2 = (5/8)MR^2. Cross-check
 *      by the annulus formula I = (1/2)M(a^2 + b^2) with a = R/2, b = R:
 *      (1/2)M(R^2/4 + R^2) = (5/8)MR^2. The source itself agrees elsewhere: a
 *      displaced run on page 407 of the extraction reads "I=5/8MR2", so the
 *      answer LIST is the defective copy. Carried into Topic 04's practice set
 *      as 5/8 MR^2.
 *   2. Round 2 Addendum C (source page 437). Printed: "H = (1/7)(1/2)m v0^2"
 *      and "Exactly one-seventh of the initial kinetic energy is destroyed",
 *      and Addendum C practice answer 3 prints the dissipated fraction as
 *      "1/7 = 14.3%". Correct: two-sevenths, 28.6%. Working, for a solid
 *      sphere thrown at v0 with no spin: K_i = (1/2)m v0^2; pure rolling
 *      begins at v = 5v0/7, where K_f = (7/10)m v^2 = (7/10)(25/49)m v0^2 =
 *      (5/14)m v0^2; so H = (7/14 − 5/14)m v0^2 = (1/7)m v0^2, which is
 *      (1/7)/(1/2) = 2/7 of K_i, not 1/7. The source's own Example C.1
 *      (m = 0.20 kg, v0 = 7.0 m/s) computes H = m v0^2/7 = 1.4 J and checks it
 *      against K_i − K_f = 4.9 − 3.5 = 1.4 J, so the numerical example is
 *      right and only the general statement and the practice answer are wrong;
 *      1.4/4.9 is 2/7. Topic 06's `protip` and its fourth MCQ carry 2/7.
 *   3. Round 2 Addendum D (source page 440). Printed, for a particle of mass m
 *      striking the end of a FREE rod of mass M and length L: "I_cm = ML^2/12
 *      + m(ML/(2(M+m)))^2", and for m = M the value 7ML^2/48 with
 *      omega = 12v/(7L). Both are wrong: the printed I_cm shifts the embedded
 *      particle to the system's centre of mass by the parallel-axis theorem
 *      but never shifts the ROD, which is no longer centred there either. With
 *      y_c = mL/(2(M+m)) the correct value is I_cm = ML^2/12 + M y_c^2 +
 *      m(L/2 − y_c)^2 = ML^2(M + 4m)/(12(M+m)), giving 5ML^2/24 = 10ML^2/48 at
 *      m = M and omega = 6mv/(L(M + 4m)) = 6v/(5L). The source's own
 *      consistency check cannot see the error because it only ever uses the
 *      PRODUCT I_cm.omega, which is MvL/4 either way. The centre-of-percussion
 *      half of Addendum D (x = 2 I_end/(ML) = 2L/3) is correct and is the only
 *      part of D used below, in a single Topic 02 `mistakes` line. The free-rod
 *      collision formula is not taught anywhere in this chapter.
 *
 * Everything else checks out. All 28 worked examples, all 35 practice items
 * and all 28 MCQ keys across the seven sub-topics were re-solved from the
 * problem statements: the CoM composite and integration results, both axis
 * theorems and every standard moment of inertia, the ladder's cot(theta)/2,
 * the beam reactions 66.7 N and 133.3 N, the bullet-in-rod 3mv/(L(M+3m)), the
 * rolling shape factors and the 5v0/7 sliding-to-rolling result all reproduce.
 * Addenda A, B, E and F were checked the same way and are clean, including
 * F's 3-4-5 geometry and its four different "minimum force" answers.
 *
 * SOURCE DAMAGE. All four patterns the brief names are present, plus three
 * this chapter has that the pilot did not. Every instance below was
 * re-authored from context, never transcribed:
 *
 *   - GREEK LETTERS SURVIVE IN MATHS AND DIE IN PROSE, which is a sharper
 *     rule than the brief's. Inside a maths run the extraction keeps them, but
 *     as Mathematical Alphanumeric codepoints (U+1D6D5 onward) that the
 *     validator rejects outright, so "tau = dL/dt" arrives readable but
 *     unusable and must be retyped in ordinary Greek. In body text and figure
 *     captions the same letters are dropped with NO placeholder, which is the
 *     damage the brief warns about: Figure 6.11's caption reads "A sphere on
 *     an incline of angle ." and "component mg sinalong the incline, mg
 *     cosperpendicular", Figure 6.12's reads "until v = Ris reached", and
 *     Figure 6.2's reads "subtending d, with its y-coordinate marked as R
 *     sin.". All three captions were rebuilt from the surrounding derivation
 *     (theta, omega, and R sin(theta) respectively) rather than from the
 *     caption text.
 *   - HEADING RUNS ARRIVE SCRAMBLED, IN TWO DIFFERENT CIPHERS. The brief's
 *     +29 ASCII shift is one of them. The other, which the brief does not
 *     name, is a keyboard-layout substitution: source page 384 opens
 *     "ai2T 1  *?QQb2 i?2 `B;?i +QMb2`p2/ [mMiBivX", which is "Step 1 - Choose
 *     the right conserved quantity." under a fixed letter map (a to S, i to t,
 *     2 to e, ? to h, Q to o, ` to r, X to a full stop). That heading is the
 *     single most important line of the bullet-in-rod example, and it is
 *     reconstructed in Topic 02's fourth worked example from the paragraph it
 *     introduces.
 *   - MATH OPERATORS ARRIVE AS BACKSLASH-LETTER TOKENS, a family the pilot met
 *     once as "\n7" for a minus sign. This chapter carries six of them and
 *     they appear on almost every derivation line: "\n7" is the minus sign
 *     (source pages 391, 394, 401, 405, 407, 412, 415, 423), "\nH" is the
 *     ellipsis in a sum (page 363, "m1 a1 + m2 a2 + ... + mn an"), "\nN" and
 *     "\nA" are the multiplication sign and the centred dot (pages 367, 401,
 *     405, 407, 415, 423, 427), "\nC" is the ratio colon (page 407,
 *     "I_hollow : I_solid = 2/3 : 2/5 = 5 : 3"), "\nK" is the degree sign
 *     (page 427, "sin 30 degrees"), and "\tU", "\tV", "\t@" and "\tz" are the
 *     large delimiters and the underbrace (pages 384, 405). Reading any of
 *     these literally would have silently deleted a minus sign from a torque
 *     or a degree sign from an angle, so each was decoded against the result
 *     the step is heading toward.
 *   - SUPERSCRIPTS LAND ON THEIR OWN LINES, which in a chapter made of MR^2,
 *     ML^2/12 and kg m^2 breaks essentially every formula in the range. The
 *     moment of inertia table on source page 401 extracts as a column of bare
 *     digits; it was rebuilt by checking each entry against the standard
 *     result for that shape and axis (see PLAUSIBILITY below), not by
 *     re-reading the column.
 *   - INTER-WORD SPACES VANISH at tight kerning, pervasively. Confirmed
 *     instances behind prose used below: "rigid bodyis an idealised object"
 *     (p.356), "thelaand an empty one" (p.399), "andisplacement" and
 *     "makingthings move and spin" (p.389), "notdepend on their masses"
 *     (p.422), "everycharpai" (p.389), "spinning topgo" and "onlyfor pure
 *     rolling" (p.430), "isnotconserved here" (p.384), "shrinking Iforces
 *     omega to shoot up" (p.379).
 *   - TWO PRACTICE QUESTIONS LOST THEIR OWN STATEMENTS and had to be rebuilt
 *     from their answers plus the displaced fragments the extraction spat out
 *     elsewhere on the page. Centre of Mass practice 3 (p.367) survives only
 *     as "one corner. Find the distance of the new center of mass from the
 *     center of the original plate." with the run "a√2/6fromthecenter" adrift
 *     twelve lines away; the answer list gives a/(6√2), which is reproduced
 *     exactly by a square plate of side a with a square of side a/2 removed
 *     from one corner (shift a/12 in each coordinate, magnitude a√2/12 =
 *     a/(6√2)), so that is the question, and it is stated in full in Topic
 *     01's practice set. Moment of Inertia practice 3 and 4 (p.407) are fused
 *     into one another, with "I=5/8MR2.hasaconcentriccircularholeofradiusR/2
 *     cutout.Find" landing inside the MCQ section; the two were separated by
 *     matching each to its own answer.
 *   - ONE FIGURE CAPTION IS DUPLICATED ON TWO CONSECUTIVE PAGES, once truncated
 *     with "(see next page)" and once in full on a bare FIGURES page. Every
 *     one of the twelve captions arrives twice this way, so each figure brief
 *     below was assembled from the longer of the two copies.
 *
 * DIMENSIONS. Every formula printed below, reduced to M L T. The three that
 * matter most in this chapter are checked first, because a dropped R is
 * invisible in prose and obvious here:
 *
 *   - I = sum(m r^2): [M][L^2] = [M L^2]. Correct, and NOT [M L] however
 *     tempting: the r is squared.
 *   - tau = r F: [L][M L T^-2] = [M L^2 T^-2]. Same dimensions as energy, and
 *     that coincidence is the reason the chapter insists on N m and never J.
 *   - L = r p = I omega: [L][M L T^-1] = [M L^2 T^-1], and
 *     [M L^2][T^-1] = [M L^2 T^-1]. The two routes agree, which is the check
 *     that L = I omega has not lost a radius.
 *   - r_cm = sum(m r)/sum(m): [M][L]/[M] = [L]. ✓
 *   - F_ext = M a_cm: [M][L T^-2] = [M L T^-2]. ✓
 *   - |A x B| = AB sin(theta): the sine is dimensionless, so a cross product
 *     carries exactly the product of its factors' dimensions. For r x F that
 *     is [M L^2 T^-2]. ✓
 *   - tau = dL/dt: [M L^2 T^-1]/[T] = [M L^2 T^-2]. ✓ Matches r x F above,
 *     which is the whole content of Topic 02's derivation.
 *   - tau = I alpha: [M L^2][T^-2] = [M L^2 T^-2]. ✓ (alpha is rad/s^2 and
 *     the radian is dimensionless, so alpha reduces to [T^-2].)
 *   - K_rot = (1/2)I omega^2: [M L^2][T^-2] = [M L^2 T^-2], a joule. ✓
 *   - K = L^2/(2I): [M^2 L^4 T^-2]/[M L^2] = [M L^2 T^-2]. ✓
 *   - Angular impulse J = tau t: [M L^2 T^-2][T] = [M L^2 T^-1]. ✓ Exactly the
 *     dimensions of angular momentum, as an impulse must be.
 *   - Both equilibrium conditions: sum(F) = 0 is [M L T^-2], sum(tau) = 0 is
 *     [M L^2 T^-2]. They are DIFFERENT dimensions, which is the cleanest
 *     argument that one cannot substitute for the other.
 *   - Principle of moments F1 d1 = F2 d2: [M L^2 T^-2] both sides. ✓
 *     Mechanical advantage is a force ratio, dimensionless. ✓
 *   - Parallel axes I = I_cm + M d^2: [M L^2] + [M][L^2]. ✓
 *   - Perpendicular axes I_z = I_x + I_y: [M L^2] throughout. ✓
 *   - Radius of gyration K = sqrt(I/M): sqrt([M L^2]/[M]) = [L]. ✓ A length,
 *     which is why it can be compared with R.
 *   - v = r omega: [L][T^-1] = [L T^-1] ✓. a_t = r alpha: [L][T^-2] ✓.
 *     a_c = omega^2 r: [T^-2][L] ✓. All three land on the right side.
 *   - omega = omega_0 + alpha t: [T^-1] = [T^-1] + [T^-2][T] ✓.
 *     theta = omega_0 t + (1/2)alpha t^2: dimensionless = [T^-1][T] +
 *     [T^-2][T^2] ✓, an angle being a pure number.
 *   - Rolling K = (1/2)m v^2 (1 + K^2/R^2): the bracket is a ratio of two
 *     lengths squared, dimensionless, so the whole thing is [M L^2 T^-2] ✓.
 *   - a = g sin(theta)/(1 + K^2/R^2): [L T^-2] over a pure number ✓.
 *     v_bottom = sqrt(2gh/(1 + K^2/R^2)): sqrt([L T^-2][L]) = [L T^-1] ✓.
 *   - mu_min = tan(theta)/(1 + R^2/K^2): dimensionless over dimensionless, and
 *     a coefficient of friction must be a pure number ✓.
 *
 *   26 formula lines checked, 26 dimensionally consistent, no exceptions and
 *   no informal-units caveats of the kind the pilot's nth-second formula
 *   needed. The one near-miss worth naming is not an error: torque and energy
 *   share [M L^2 T^-2] exactly, so dimensional analysis cannot tell them apart
 *   and the unit convention (N m for torque, J for energy) has to do it
 *   instead. That is said out loud in Topic 02.
 *
 * PHYSICAL PLAUSIBILITY AND LIMITING CASES. Every printed moment of inertia
 * was checked against the standard result for that shape and axis: ring MR^2,
 * ring about a diameter MR^2/2, disc MR^2/2, disc about a diameter MR^2/4,
 * rod about its centre ML^2/12, rod about an end ML^2/3, solid sphere
 * (2/5)MR^2, spherical shell (2/3)MR^2, solid cylinder MR^2/2. Two internal
 * consistency checks are used in the chapter itself rather than merely
 * performed: the parallel-axis theorem takes the rod from ML^2/12 to ML^2/3
 * (Topic 04's `deriv`), and the perpendicular-axis theorem takes the disc from
 * MR^2/2 to MR^2/4 about a diameter (Topic 04's third `ex`). No moment of
 * inertia anywhere below is negative or smaller than MK^2 for a K exceeding
 * the body's own radius. No rolling body is given v greater than omega R;
 * every v = R omega in the chapter is flagged as holding only for pure
 * rolling, and Topic 06's slipping example is the one place v exceeds omega R,
 * explicitly and by construction. Limiting cases used where they teach:
 * Topic 05's pulley result a = 2mg/(2m + M) is checked at M -> 0 (free fall,
 * a -> g) and at large M (a -> 0); Topic 04 checks the ring against the disc
 * (all mass at R gives exactly twice the disc's value, because the disc's
 * mass is spread inward); Topic 06 checks that a rolling body's acceleration
 * collapses to g sin(theta) as K^2/R^2 -> 0, which is a body with no
 * rotational inertia, i.e. a sliding block; and Topic 01 checks the
 * semicircular wire's 2R/pi against the semicircular disc's 4R/3pi, the
 * classic examiner's pair.
 *
 * SEAMS: what is quoted as already known, and from which file. The cross
 * product is NOT one of them. math-12-10-vector-algebra.ts teaches it (its
 * Topic 04, "The Cross Product: Area and the Perpendicular Direction",
 * determinant form and parallelogram area included), but that is a Class 12
 * Mathematics chapter and a Class 11 Physics student has not met it, which is
 * exactly why the source gives the vector product seven pages of its own.
 * Topic 02 therefore builds it from scratch, in physics terms, and the maths
 * chapter is a forward reference rather than a prerequisite. What IS quoted:
 * the derivative as dx/dt and the definite integral as an accumulated area,
 * both from math-11-12-limits.ts and both already leaned on by
 * phy-11-02-motion-straight-line.ts, are used without re-derivation in Topic
 * 01's continuous-body integration, Topic 02's d(r x p)/dt, and Topic 04's
 * two moment-of-inertia integrals; the product rule, which Topic 02's
 * derivation applies to a cross product, is quoted from that same file's Topic
 * 05. Newton's second law, the work-energy theorem, conservation of linear
 * momentum, static friction and mu N, and projectile motion's H = u^2 sin^2
 * (theta)/2g are all quoted from Class 11 Physics chapters 4, 5 and 3 as
 * known; Topic 02's third worked example uses the projectile result verbatim
 * rather than re-deriving it.
 *
 * FIGURES. Fifteen `diagram` blocks: all twelve named figures drawn, plus
 * three designed. None dropped, and no new figure vocabulary requested. The
 * three designed ones are Topic 02's two-chip "what the moment arm is",
 * Topic 04's five-chip standard-moments table, and Topic 06's three-chip
 * decomposition of rolling into translation plus rotation. The panel rule is
 * observed everywhere: Figure 6.1's three source panels are three CHIPS of one
 * block, and the moment of inertia table is five chips, never a grid inside
 * one frame. Two lessons the pilot paid for and this chapter inherits are
 * visible in the geometry: an axis of rotation is never drawn collinear with
 * the omega arrow that names it (Figures 6.1 and 6.9 offset one from the
 * other), and every point label with a line leaving it to the north-east

          "html": "<b>01 · Rigid Bodies and the Centre of Mass</b><br>The foundations here are rarely asked alone, but every later problem silently assumes them. CBSE Boards expect the <i>motion of the centre of mass</i> derivation and clean definitions, plus the occasional 1-mark definition of a rigid body or a type of motion. JEE Main asks one to two direct questions almost every year, usually a composite body or a mass-removal problem. NEET keeps it light, typically one conceptual question about explosions or the man-on-a-boat. JEE Advanced likes continuous bodies and integration.<br><br><b>02 · Torque and Angular Momentum</b><br>The dynamical heart of the chapter, and the cross product is its engine. JEE Main asks one to two questions yearly on τ = <i>dL</i>/<i>dt</i>, on conservation, or on the angular momentum of a projectile, plus roughly one straight cross-product question, a perpendicular unit vector or the area of a triangle. NEET keeps it conceptual: the spinning-skater idea and <i>is angular momentum conserved here</i>. JEE Advanced pushes into angular impulse and collisions involving rotation. CBSE Boards wants the τ = <i>dL</i>/<i>dt</i> derivation, the conservation law stated cleanly, and the definition and properties of the vector product.<br><br><b>03 · Equilibrium of a Rigid Body</b><br>A CBSE favourite and a steady JEE and NEET performer. CBSE Boards regularly asks the principle of moments, levers and centre of gravity for 2 to 3 marks. JEE Main poses beam-and-support and ladder-against-wall problems. NEET keeps it conceptual: the conditions for equilibrium and the three types of equilibrium. Master this and <i>find the reactions</i> stops being intimidating and becomes bookkeeping.<br><br><b>04 · Moment of Inertia</b><br>The most formula-dense slice of the chapter, and examiners love it. JEE Main asks one to two questions every year on composite bodies, the two axis theorems, or the radius of gyration. NEET keeps it factual: the standard-body values and what moment of inertia depends on. JEE Advanced demands integration from scratch and clever theorem combinations. CBSE Boards wants the rod or ring derivation and clean statements of both theorems.<br><br><b>05 · Rotational Kinematics and Dynamics</b><br>This is where the whole chapter ties together. JEE Main asks one to two questions yearly, with constant-α kinematics and pulley or connected-body τ = <i>I</i>α problems perennial. NEET favours direct numericals and the <i>v</i> = <i>r</i>ω relation. JEE Advanced pushes into connected systems, energy methods and variable torque. CBSE Boards wants the τ = <i>I</i>α derivation, rotational kinetic energy, and the kinematic equations.<br><br><b>06 · Rolling Motion</b><br>The chapter's grand finale, fusing translation and rotation into one motion. JEE Main asks one to two questions yearly: inclined-plane acceleration, the kinetic-energy split, or the <i>which body wins the race</i> classic. NEET loves the energy ratio and the race ordering. JEE Advanced pushes into rolling-with-slipping transitions and friction analysis. CBSE Boards wants the rolling kinetic energy expression and the pure-rolling condition <i>v</i> = <i>R</i>ω."

          "html": "Every mechanics problem you have solved so far quietly shrank the object to a dot. A block, a ball, a car, all collapsed to a single point carrying mass. That worked while you only cared about <i>where</i> something went. It cannot explain <i>spinning</i>, because a point has no size, so it cannot turn about itself, wobble, or roll. To study rotation you need objects with extent, and the simplest such object is the <b>rigid body</b>: an idealised object in which the distance between any two of its particles never changes, whatever forces act on it. It never stretches, compresses or bends. Real bats, flywheels, spanners and planets deform a little, but so little that treating them as perfectly rigid predicts their motion beautifully."

In <b>pure translation</b> every particle moves with the same velocity at the same instant, tracing parallel paths: a book slid flat across a table, a suitcase carried straight forward. No line drawn on the body changes its direction. In <b>pure rotation about a fixed axis</b> every particle moves in a circle, and all those circles are centred on one fixed line, the axis: a ceiling fan, a merry-go-round, the hands of a clock. Particles farther from the axis move faster, at <i>v</i> = <i>r</i>ω, but every one of them shares the same angular speed. In <b>general motion</b> the two happen at once: a rolling wheel whose centre glides forward while the wheel spins about that centre, a thrown spinning bat, a tumbling gymnast. The master strategy of this entire chapter is to split general motion into translation of the centre of mass plus rotation about the centre of mass, handle each with its own laws, and add the results."

Push the top of a cupboard forward while a friend pushes the bottom backward with an equal force. The net force is zero, so the cupboard will not slide. It will still happily topple.
