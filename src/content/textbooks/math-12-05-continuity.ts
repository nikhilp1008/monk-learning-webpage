/**
 * Chapter 05 · Continuity and Differentiability, Mathematics, Class 12.
 *
 * Restructured from the Drona Class 12 Mathematics Master Reference (pages 273
 * to 348) into the block system in design_handoff_textbooks/CONTENT_SPEC.md,
 * matching the voice and density of math-12-01-relations.ts.
 *
 * The source is two documents stacked: a typeset chapter of seven subtopics
 * (pages 274 to 320) and a Round 2 Addendum of six inserts (pages 321 to 348):
 * A standard limits, B differentiating through moduli, C functional equations,
 * D Cauchy's Mean Value Theorem and root counting, E greatest-integer
 * compositions, P a previous-year analysis. Six topics is the schema's
 * ceiling, so the addenda are folded into the topic they belong to rather than
 * given topics of their own. Addendum P is not a topic either: its
 * distribution table feeds the hook, its seven archetypes feed the worked
 * examples, and its ten engineered traps feed the `mistakes` cards.
 *
 * WHAT CLASS 11 ALREADY TEACHES, AND IS THEREFORE NOT RE-TAUGHT HERE
 *
 * 1. Subtopic 02, "The Differentiation Toolkit", is dropped. Every standard
 *    derivative, the sum, constant-multiple, product and quotient rules, the
 *    first-principle proof of d/dx sin x and the derivation of the quotient
 *    rule from the product rule are all in math-11-12-limits.ts, topic 05
 *    ("Rules of Differentiation"), with topic 04 carrying the standard-
 *    derivative table and the first-principle drill. The one thing in
 *    Subtopic 02 that Class 11 does not have is the ALGEBRA OF CONTINUOUS
 *    FUNCTIONS, which is the entire reason only junctions need testing; it is
 *    folded into topic 01 here as a defgrid.
 *
 * 2. Subtopic 03, "The Chain Rule", is not given a topic. math-11-12-limits.ts
 *    topic 05 already states it, states the power chain, gives the
 *    rate-multiplying reason, and says so in its own note ("The chain rule
 *    formally sits in the Class 12 syllabus, but every JEE course teaches it
 *    in Class 11"). What survives is the part Class 11 never asks for: deep
 *    nesting with the one-factor-per-layer count, and the two differentiability
 *    conditions on the links. That is folded into topic 03 as the run-up to
 *    implicit differentiation, which is the first place the chain rule does
 *    work no other rule can.
 *
 * 3. Addendum A, the six standard limits, is quoted rather than derived. All
 *    six live in math-11-12-limits.ts topic 03 ("The Standard Limits"),
 *    including the sandwich proof of sin x / x and the half in
 *    (1 − cos x)/x². They appear here as one defgrid of known stock, and the
 *    space goes to what the addendum is actually for: routing a junction limit
 *    into them to find the constant k.
 *
 * 4. Addendum C's "differentiable shortcut" (f(x + y) = f(x) f(y) with f
 *    differentiable at 0 gives f′ = f′(0) f) is math-11-12-limits.ts topic 04,
 *    defgrid "Functional equations, where the rules have nothing to act on",
 *    with the same four equations and the same worked example. Not repeated.
 *
 * A CLASS 11 GAP THIS CHAPTER FILLS
 *
 * Class 11 propagates a DERIVATIVE from one point using a functional equation.
 * It never propagates CONTINUITY. Addendum C's Theorem C.1, that an additive
 * function continuous at a single point is continuous everywhere and therefore
 * linear, is genuinely new, and it is the reason the JEE phrasing "continuous
 * at exactly one point" is not a typo. It is built in topic 01.
 *
 * Class 11 also draws |x| as a corner. It is drawn again here, because in
 * Class 12 it carries the whole weight of the one-way bridge, and this time
 * the two disagreeing one-sided tangents are actually on the page rather than
 * named in a label.
 *
 * FIGURES
 *
 * Eight `diagram` blocks, all `plot`. Three species of discontinuity (topic
 * 01); where the derivative dies, which is |x| with its two tangent rays, the
 * source's own Figure 5.1 corner at (2, 4), and a vertical tangent (topic 02);
 * the floor of a curve, where a minimum on an integer level is harmless and a
 * maximum on it is fatal (topic 02); the circle x² + y² = 25 with its slope
 * −x/y and its vertical tangent (topic 03); sin inverse of sin t as a triangle
 * wave, which is the principal-range trap drawn (topic 04); the parametric
 * parabola x = at², y = 2at (topic 05); concavity from the sign of y″ and the
 * two Mean Value Theorems (topic 06).
 *
 * ONE FIGURE DROPPED. The source's meshing-gears picture for the chain rule
 * (three shafts and their gear ratios, page 290) needs a mechanical schematic.
 * None of the implemented kinds (plot, numberline, unitcircle, tree, pascal,
 * axes3d) can draw it and no new kind may be added, so the gears survive in
 * prose only.
 *
 * ERRATA (source pages 830 to 832): the list carries entries for chapters 1, 3
 * and 11 and NONE for chapter 5. Nothing to apply.
 *
 * ERRORS FOUND BY RE-SOLVING (the corrected version is what this chapter
 * teaches; the printed one is not reproduced anywhere):
 *
 *   - Page 326, Addendum B, Lemma B.3: "In general, |x|ⁿ is differentiable
 *     exactly n − 1 times at the origin." False for even n, and contradicted
 *     four lines above it by the source's own n = 2 bullet, which correctly
 *     says |x|² = x² is a polynomial and infinitely differentiable. The rule
 *     holds for ODD n only: |x|³ is twice differentiable and not three times
 *     (its second derivative is 6|x|, which has a corner), while |x|⁴ = x⁴ is
 *     smooth to every order. Topic 02 states the odd-n restriction.
 *
 *   - Page 319, Subtopic 07, MCQ Q2 distractor gloss: for f(x) = x² on [1, 3]
 *     the keyed answer c = 2 is correct, but the gloss on option (d) 1.5 reads
 *     "is the arithmetic midpoint (1+3)/2, which is not what MVT delivers for a
 *     parabola". Both halves are wrong. (1 + 3)/2 = 2, not 1.5. And for
 *     f(x) = x² the Mean Value point IS always the midpoint, because
 *     2c = (b² − a²)/(b − a) = a + b. So the gloss denies the very fact that
 *     makes the keyed answer right. Topic 06 teaches the midpoint result and
 *     reads 1.5 for what it actually is, the midpoint of [1, 2].
 *
 *   - Page 342, Addendum P, Archetype 4: for y = sin⁻¹(2x/(1 + x²)), "At
 *     x = ±1 derivative does not exist (cusp)." It is a CORNER, not a cusp.
 *     The one-sided derivatives at x = 1 are +2/(1 + x²) = +1 and
 *     −2/(1 + x²) = −1, both finite, and page 275 of the same book defines a
 *     cusp as a point "where the slope blows up to infinity". The source
 *     contradicts its own definition. Topic 04 says corner.
 *
 * PRODUCTION DAMAGE, RE-AUTHORED RATHER THAN GUESSED:
 *
 *   - Page 281, Subtopic 01, Practice answers: the answer to Q1 is missing
 *     from the answer line, which reads "Answers: 1. 2. continuous (LHL = RHL
 *     = 0 = f(5))…", with a stray "=1" left stranded at the foot of the page.
 *     Re-solved: for f(x) = ax + 5 on x ≤ 3 and x² − 1 on x > 3, continuity at
 *     3 needs 3a + 5 = 8, so a = 1, which the stranded fragment confirms. That
 *     is the answer carried in topic 01's practice card.
 *   - Throughout the extracted text the minus sign arrives as an escape
 *     sequence and colons in "f : [a, b] → ℝ" arrive as control characters.
 *     Cosmetic only; every affected expression was re-read from context.
 *
 * TWO NOTES FOR WHOEVER EDITS THE FIGURES. Chips and captions render as plain
 * text, so they carry no inline tags. And the first curve of a frame is drawn
 * in ink and every later one in amber unless it is `soft`, so the order of
 * `curves` decides which curve the eye reads first.

CBSE Boards carry a 1 to 4 mark question almost every year: check continuity at a point, or find the constant that makes a piecewise function continuous. JEE Main reliably asks 1 to 2 questions on piecewise, modulus or greatest-integer functions, and continuity of piecewise functions is the <b>single largest block</b> in the 43-year bank, roughly 25 to 30 of about 140 questions. JEE Advanced pushes into functional equations and functions built to misbehave. Not in NEET, the medical paper has no mathematics section.<br><br><b>02 · Differentiability, and Counting Where It Fails</b><br>20 to 25 questions in the bank and present in every decade without exception. CBSE examines differentiability at a join for 2 to 4 marks. JEE Main's favourite phrasing is <b>“at how many points”</b>, applied to a modulus or greatest-integer expression, which is a counting question wearing a calculus hat. JEE Advanced asks the subtle version: a function that is differentiable everywhere and whose derivative is not even continuous.<br><br><b>03 · The Chain Rule and Implicit Differentiation</b><br>A guaranteed scorer. CBSE asks for <i>dy</i>/<i>dx</i> of a relation like <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>y</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>a</i><sup>2</sup> or sin(<i>xy</i>) = <i>x</i> for 2 to 4 marks. Composite-function questions are 15 to 20 of the bank and implicit ones another 5 to 8, and JEE Advanced pushes implicit into second derivatives and curve-tangent problems.<br><br><b>04 · Inverse Trigonometric Derivatives</b><br>10 to 12 of the bank, and one of the highest-yield areas for JEE. CBSE asks direct derivatives plus one simplify-by-substitution problem for 3 to 4 marks. JEE Advanced routinely penalises an answer that ignores the principal range, because outside it the simplification changes and <b>the sign of the derivative flips</b>.<br><br><b>05 · Logarithmic and Parametric Differentiation</b><br>Two reliable mark-earners. CBSE almost always includes a logarithmic sum, a variable power or a large product, and frequently a parametric <i>dy</i>/<i>dx</i>, typically 2 to 4 marks each. The bank holds 8 to 10 logarithmic and 10 to 12 parametric questions. The <b>parametric second-derivative ratio</b> is the most-tested single error in the chapter.<br><br><b>06 · Second Derivatives and the Mean Value Theorems</b><br>A dependable scoring zone. CBSE almost always carries a second-order relation to prove, such as <i>y</i>″ + <i>n</i><sup>2</sup><i>y</i> = 0, plus frequently a “verify Rolle” question. 12 to 15 second-derivative questions and 10 to 12 Mean Value questions sit in the bank. JEE Advanced does not verify these theorems, it <b>uses</b> them, to prove inequalities and to bound how many roots an equation can have."

If <i>u</i> spins three times per turn of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> spins five times per turn of <i>u</i>, then <i>y</i> spins fifteen times per turn of <i>x</i>. <b>Rates multiply along the chain.</b>"
