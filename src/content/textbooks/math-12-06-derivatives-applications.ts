/**
 * Chapter 06 · Applications of Derivatives, Mathematics, Class 12.
 *
 * Restructured from the Drona Class 12 Mathematics Master Reference (pages 349
 * to 409) into the block system in design_handoff_textbooks/CONTENT_SPEC.md,
 * matching the voice and density of math-12-01-relations.ts. The catalogue
 * calls this chapter "Applications of Derivatives", plural; the source's own
 * running head says "Application of Derivatives" at page 349 and
 * "Applications of Derivatives" at page 385. The catalogue's title is the one
 * used here, because that is what the Chapters screen matches on.
 *
 * The source is two documents stacked. A typeset chapter of three subtopics
 * (Rate of Change, Monotonicity, Maxima and Minima) plus two appendices that
 * the NCERT rationalisation removed from the board syllabus (A: Tangents and
 * Normals; B: Approximations and Differentials), pages 349 to 384. Then a
 * Round 2 Addendum of six inserts, pages 385 to 409: A Rolle and the Mean
 * Value Theorem, B monotonicity for root counting and chained inequalities,
 * C the n-th derivative test with concavity and inflection, D extrema on open
 * and unbounded domains, E subtangent and subnormal geometry, and P a
 * previous-year analysis of roughly 130 recoverable questions, 1979 to 2020.
 *
 * Editorial decisions worth recording:
 *
 * 1. Six topics, and the addenda are folded into the topic they belong to
 *    rather than given topics of their own. Appendix B (approximations and
 *    differentials) folds into topic 01, because a differential and a rate are
 *    the same derivative used two ways and the source itself measures the
 *    material at zero recoverable previous-year questions. Addendum E folds
 *    into topic 02 beside Appendix A, which it completes. Addendum C folds
 *    into topic 04, where the Second Derivative Test admits the hole that the
 *    n-th derivative test patches. Addendum D folds into topic 05, whose
 *    closed-interval working rule it repairs for domains with no endpoints.
 *    Addenda A and B become topic 06 together, because root counting is MVT
 *    and monotonicity used as one tool. Addendum P is not a topic: its
 *    distribution table feeds the hook, its seven archetypes feed the worked
 *    examples, and its nine engineered traps feed the `mistakes` cards.
 *
 * 2. Nothing here re-teaches differentiation. math-11-12-limits.ts, topic 04
 *    (The Derivative from First Principle) and topic 05 (Rules of
 *    Differentiation), already carries the limit definition, the product,
 *    quotient and chain rules, the full trigonometric set, and the
 *    derivatives of e^x, a^x and ln x, and it teaches the chain rule as
 *    "rates multiply", which is exactly the related-rates bridge. So the
 *    source's Subtopic 01 Section 2 restatement of the chain rule is quoted
 *    as known rather than derived, and topic 01 here spends the derivative
 *    instead of building it.
 *
 * 3. The hook is merged, as in every chapter here. The source carries an
 *    "Exam Relevance" panel per subtopic plus Addendum P's distribution
 *    table; the reader renders `hook` on topic 1 only, so all of it is
 *    gathered into that one accordion under six bold headings.
 *
 * 4. Twelve `diagram` blocks: eleven `plot` and one `numberline`, two per
 *    topic. Six of the source's seven named figures are drawn (6.1 the
 *    sliding ladder, 6.2 the inverted cone, 6.3 the sign-chart number line,
 *    6.5 the peak and trough with their horizontal tangents, 6.6 the cylinder
 *    inscribed in a sphere, 6.7 the two parabolas and the angle at (1, 1)).
 *    The rest are figures this chapter cannot be taught without: the tangent
 *    and the normal at one point of contact; f drawn together with f' in one
 *    frame, so the zeros of f' land visibly under the turning points of f;
 *    the x squared, x cubed, x fourth trio, which is the first-derivative-test
 *    failure case and the second-test silence side by side; the closed
 *    interval [0, 3] where the absolute maximum sits at an endpoint; the open
 *    box drawn as its net, as a polygon, beside the volume curve it produces;
 *    and the chord-and-parallel-tangent pair for Rolle and MVT, plus the
 *    three-value root audit for x^3 - 3x + k.
 *
 *    ONE FIGURE DROPPED. Source Figure 6.4 asks for y = 2 sin x + tan x drawn
 *    above y = 3x on (0, pi/2). `PlotCurve` is a closed vocabulary of named
 *    curves with no way to add two of them, so the sum cannot be drawn. Its
 *    Taylor polynomial 3x + 0.15x^5 is drawable and is a genuinely good
 *    picture of the inequality, but labelling an approximation with the true
 *    function's name would be dishonest, so the figure is dropped rather than
 *    faked. No new `kind` was added; every kind used here is already in
 *    components/textbook/diagrams.tsx.
 *
 * ERRATA (source pages 830 to 832): the list carries entries for Chapters 1,
 * 3 and 11 only. There is no Chapter 6 entry, so nothing was applied.
 *
 * ERRORS FOUND WHILE RE-SOLVING (the corrected value is what this chapter
 * teaches, and each is named where a student meets it):
 *
 *   - Page 398, Addendum D, Practice Q5. The closest points on y = x^2 to
 *     (0, 2) are printed correctly as (+-sqrt6/2, 3/2), but the distance is
 *     printed "sqrt(5/2) = sqrt10/2", about 1.58. It is wrong. The book's own
 *     objective is g = x^2 + (x^2 - 2)^2 = x^4 - 3x^2 + 4, and its own
 *     critical value is x^2 = 3/2, from g' = 2x(2x^2 - 3). Substituting:
 *     (3/2)^2 - 3(3/2) + 4 = 9/4 - 18/4 + 16/4 = 7/4, not 5/2. The distance
 *     is sqrt(7/4) = sqrt7/2, about 1.32. Checked directly too: the point
 *     (1.2247, 1.5) is sqrt(1.5 + 0.25) = sqrt1.75 from (0, 2). Corrected in
 *     topic 05's practice card, with the arithmetic shown.
 *
 *   - Page 389, Addendum A, Practice Q2 answer. Asked why the MVT fails for
 *     f(x) = 1/x on [-1, 1], the printed answer says "f(-1) = f(1) = -1 would
 *     require some c with f'(c) = 0". That is false and it argues from the
 *     wrong theorem: f(-1) = -1 but f(1) = +1, so the endpoint values are not
 *     equal and Rolle was never applicable. The MVT conclusion does fail, but
 *     for a different reason: it would demand f'(c) = (f(1) - f(-1))/2 = 1,
 *     while f'(x) = -1/x^2 is negative wherever it exists. The printed
 *     punchline about f' < 0 is right; the setup it hangs on is not.
 *     Corrected in topic 06's practice card.
 *
 *   - Page 360, Subtopic 02, Section 2. The sharpened monotonicity criterion
 *     is stated as "f'(x) >= 0 with f'(x) = 0 only at finitely many isolated
 *     points". True, but too narrow to support the book's own answer key: on
 *     page 366 its MCQ Q2 marks f(x) = x - sin x strictly increasing on R,
 *     and f' = 1 - cos x vanishes at x = 2n*pi for every integer n, which is
 *     infinitely many points. The condition that matters is that the zeros be
 *     isolated, not that there be finitely many of them. This chapter states
 *     it as "isolated" throughout and records the discrepancy in the formula
 *     card's note in topic 03.
 *
 * Two further things noticed and deliberately not treated as errors. Page 369
 * defines a local maximum by "f(c) > f(x) for all x in (c - h, c + h)", which
 * is false at x = c itself; NCERT writes "for all x != c" and this chapter
 * follows NCERT without comment, since it is a slipped quantifier rather than
 * a wrong value. And page 400, Example E.1, contains a visible self-
 * correction: it computes PT as sqrt13/3, writes "recompute", and arrives at
 * the correct sqrt10/3. The published value is right, so nothing is corrected;
 * this chapter simply states sqrt10/3.
 *
 * PDF EXTRACTION DAMAGE, re-authored rather than guessed. The extract renders
 * the minus sign as "{n7", the multiplication dot as "{nA", the degree sign
 * as "{nK" and a closing bracket as "{t@", and several headings arrive
 * mojibaked ("(xample - >-(( 0ain /evel@" for "Example 3 - [JEE Main Level]",
 * "6HFWLRQ 3UDFWLFH ([HUFLVHV" for "Section 5: Practice Exercises"). Every
 * affected statement was reconstructed from the surrounding mathematics and
 * re-solved before use; none of it was copied through.

          "html": "<b>01 · Rates of Change and Related Rates</b><br>A dependable CBSE Boards question: a 2 to 3 mark related-rates problem, an expanding circle, a sliding ladder, an inflating balloon or a filling cone, appears almost every year. JEE Main carries one regularly. The previous-year bank shows the shape of it sharply: near absent before 2000, then a tight cluster in Main 2013, 2014, 2019 twice and 2020 twice, about 7 percent of the recoverable pool. Examiners recycle these almost verbatim, and the same iron ball coated with melting ice, same radius, same melt rate, was set in April 2019 and again in January 2020. It is also the launch pad for the chapter, because <b>derivative equals rate</b> underpins everything after it. Approximations and differentials ride along here: the bank supplied with this chapter holds <b>no</b> recoverable question on them, so learn the one formula and move on.<br><br><b>02 · Tangents, Normals and the Angle Between Curves</b><br>Removed from CBSE Boards in the NCERT rationalisation, and the second-largest block in the JEE bank at roughly 30 percent, continuous across every era from 1983 to 2020 with a heavy 2013 to 2017 Main cluster. A board-only student may skip it. Nobody else should: it increasingly rides on <b>implicit and parametric</b> curves rather than <i>y</i> = <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>), and the subtangent and subnormal geometry behind it is a standing JEE pattern.<br><br><b>03 · Increasing and Decreasing Functions</b><br>A guaranteed scorer. CBSE almost always carries a 3 mark <b>“find the intervals in which <i>f</i> is strictly increasing”</b> question, plus a HOTS inequality or a “show <i>f</i> is increasing on ℝ” proof. JEE Main puts 1 to 2 a year, usually a parameter range or a “which of these is monotonic” MCQ. About 20 percent of the bank. At Advanced level monotonicity is rarely the question: it is the <b>engine</b> inside inequality proofs and root counting, and the board-level interval question is only the entry fee.<br><br><b>04 · Maxima and Minima: Locating and Certifying</b><br>The largest block in the bank, roughly 40 percent, present in virtually every session from 1979 to 2020. CBSE carries a short local-extremum problem alongside the optimisation word problem. JEE Main asks 2 to 3 a year: local extrema, absolute extrema on an interval, or a parameter condition. The most carefully engineered trap in the chapter lives here, that <i>f</i>′(<i>c</i>) = 0 alone proves nothing, and its companion, that a failed second-derivative test still has an answer.<br><br><b>05 · Absolute Extrema and Applied Optimisation</b><br>The famous open box, least material and largest area questions, worth 3 to 5 marks at Boards. JEE Main's favourite forms are the fitted-cost problem, the constrained solid and the closest point on a curve. The <b>endpoint audit</b> is the step most students drop, and the bank's own showpiece peaks at an endpoint on purpose. Half of these questions live on domains with no endpoints at all, where the closed-interval rule returns nothing and a different existence argument is needed.<br><br><b>06 · Rolle, the Mean Value Theorem and Root Counting</b><br>MVT was deleted from the CBSE syllabus and JEE Main did not delete it: “verify Rolle and find <i>c</i>” and “use MVT to bound this” appear regularly, and JEE Advanced uses it as a root-existence tool. It is also the hidden engine under the monotonicity theorem this chapter uses without proof. The Advanced habit is to hide Rolle inside a condition on a sum of coefficients, and to ask how many real roots an equation has as a parameter moves."
