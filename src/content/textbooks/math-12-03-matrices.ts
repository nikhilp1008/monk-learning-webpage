/**
 * Chapter 03 · Matrices. Mathematics, Class 12.
 *
 * Restructured from pages 150 to 208 of the Drona Class 12 Mathematics Master
 * Reference into the block system in design_handoff_textbooks/CONTENT_SPEC.md,
 * following math-11-01-sets.ts and math-11-06-permutations.ts for voice and
 * density.
 *
 * The source is two documents stacked: a typeset chapter of five subtopics
 * (00 Foundations and Representation, 01 Matrix Algebra and Operations, 02
 * Symmetric and Skew-Symmetric, 03 Invertible Matrices and Row Operations, 04
 * Special Square Matrices and Chapter Synthesis) and a Round 2 Addendum of six
 * parts (A near-diagonal powers, B matrix equations through the inverse, C
 * counting structured matrices, D inversion meets symmetry and orthogonality,
 * E the trace, P what JEE actually asks). There is no Round 1 Supplement for
 * this chapter.
 *
 * Six topics is the schema's ceiling, so the addenda are folded into the topic
 * that already owns their engine rather than given topics of their own:
 *
 *   - Addendum C, counting structured matrices, sits in Topic 03 directly
 *     under the free-entry counts n(n + 1)/2 and n(n − 1)/2 it exponentiates.
 *     Counting it anywhere else would state the free-cell count twice.
 *   - Addendum B, AX = B and side discipline, sits in Topic 04. Subtopic 03
 *     builds the inverse and never spends it; spending it is the board
 *     question, and it belongs next to the reduction that produced it.
 *   - Addendum D splits along its own seam: the bridge identity and the two
 *     symmetry corollaries go to Topic 04 with the other inverse laws, and the
 *     orthogonal material goes to Topic 05 where orthogonality is defined.
 *   - Addendum E, the trace, sits in Topic 05 under Subtopic 04's own trace
 *     section, which asserts tr(AB) = tr(BA) and never proves it.
 *   - Addendum A, the truncated binomial for λI + N, and Subtopic 04's matrix
 *     polynomials become Topic 06, together with Addendum P's archetypes. That
 *     is the one body of material the printed chapter genuinely under-serves,
 *     and by P's own count it is roughly a third of the JEE bank.
 *
 * Deliberate compressions. Subtopic 01's type list (row, column, square,
 * diagonal, scalar, identity, null, triangular) is pulled forward into Topic
 * 01, where representation lives, rather than sitting between addition and
 * multiplication. Addendum P's paper-by-paper distribution table is carried as
 * hook copy and as example provenance rather than reproduced: a student needs
 * to know which shapes repeat, not which session each came from.
 *
 * ONE SOURCE ERROR THE ERRATA DOES NOT COVER. Round 2 Addendum, Practice A,
 * question 5 (page 190) prints
 *
 *     A¹⁰ = 2¹⁰ I + 10 · 2⁸ N + 45 · 2⁷ N² = 1024 I + 2560 N + 5760 N²
 *
 * for A = 2I + N with N³ = O. Both scalars are one power of 2 too small. The
 * book's own formula on page 188 is (λI + N)ⁿ = λⁿ I + nλⁿ⁻¹ N + C(n,2)λⁿ⁻² N²,
 * which at λ = 2, n = 10 gives 2¹⁰ I + 10 · 2⁹ N + 45 · 2⁸ N², that is
 *
 *     A¹⁰ = 1024 I + 5120 N + 11520 N².
 *
 * The corrected values are what Topic 06 teaches and practises. The errata at
 * the back of the book (pages 830 to 832) lists exactly one Chapter 3 item,
 * the truncated order list for a 24-element matrix on page 153; that
 * correction is applied in Topic 01, where the full list of eight orders is
 * printed. Every other numerical answer in the chapter and the addendum was
 * recomputed and checks out.
 *
 * Two notation conventions, both forced by components/textbook/markup.tsx.
 * Transpose is written with the literal raised glyph ᵀ rather than <sup>T</sup>:
 * the renderer's superscript table has no capital T, so a tagged T falls back
 * to small text sitting on the baseline, and "Aᵀ = A" would read as a product.
 * Inverses use <sup>−1</sup> in markup fields and ⁻¹ in the plain-text ones
 * (chips, captions, deriv.why, snapshot.note and aids, def.term, formula
 * kicker and tag, proc and defgrid titles, ex.tag), which render identically.
 * Display matrices are drawn with the bracket pieces ⎡ ⎢ ⎣ ⎤ ⎥ ⎦ and <br>
 * between rows; in running prose a matrix is named by its rows instead.
 *
 * Three `diagram` blocks, deliberately few. There is no matrix-grid figure
 * kind and a matrix is honest as text, so the order tables, the operation
 * table and the free-cell counts are `defgrid`, and every displayed matrix is
 * a `formula` or a `deriv` step. The three figures are the places where the
 * mathematics is genuinely geometric: a `plot` of the unit square under AB and
 * under BA, which is what non-commutativity looks like; a `plot` of a singular
 * matrix flattening the plane onto a line, which is why no inverse exists; and
 * a `unitcircle` for the rotation matrix, whose first column is the point the
 * sweep lands on. Chips and captions render as plain text, so they carry no
 * inline tags.

          "html": "<b>01 · Building a Grid, Counting the Grids</b><br>Almost every CBSE paper opens the matrices section here, with a construct-the-matrix or find-the-order question worth 1–2 marks. They are the cheapest marks in the chapter and students lose them only through carelessness. JEE Main turns the same idea into fast objective counting: how many orders does a 36-element matrix have, how many 3 × 3 matrices can be built from two symbols. (NEET does not test mathematics.)<br><br><b>02 · The Three Operations</b><br>Near-guaranteed marks on CBSE Boards, where equality of matrices and the three operations appear as 1–3 mark questions almost every year, usually as <b>find the unknowns</b> from a matrix equation. JEE Main reliably carries one question on multiplication, powers or non-commutativity, and the traps are all in one cluster: <i>AB</i> ≠ <i>BA</i>, <i>AB</i> = <i>O</i> without a zero factor, and no cancellation. JEE Advanced rarely tests this alone; it weaves it into longer problems.<br><br><b>03 · Transpose, Symmetric and Skew</b><br>A perennial CBSE favourite: <b>express a matrix as the sum of a symmetric and a skew-symmetric matrix</b> is almost a fixed 3–4 mark question, and one-mark identifications appear alongside it. JEE Main asks one property question a year, typically the nature of <i>AB</i> − <i>BA</i>, the parity of powers of a skew matrix, or a count of structured matrices. JEE Advanced folds the same transpose-flip into longer classifications.<br><br><b>04 · Inverses by Row Operations</b><br><b>Find the inverse using elementary row operations</b> is a standard 4-mark CBSE question, sometimes 6 marks for a 3 × 3, and <b>express the system as AX = B and solve</b> is a fixed 4–6 mark item. JEE Main tests invertibility conditions, the reversal law (<i>AB</i>)<sup>−1</sup> = <i>B</i><sup>−1</sup><i>A</i><sup>−1</sup>, and punishes multiplying from the wrong side. The determinant test arrives in Chapter 4; nothing in this topic needs it.<br><br><b>05 · Special Matrices and the Trace</b><br>Idempotent, involutory, nilpotent and orthogonal matrices are JEE Main and Advanced favourites, both on their own and buried inside multi-step problems. Counting matrices under a trace condition, for instance the 3 × 3 matrices over {−1, 0, 1} with tr(<i>AA</i>ᵀ) = 3, is one of the most repeated shapes in the whole question bank. CBSE tests the trace rules lightly, usually as a one-liner.<br><br><b>06 · High Powers and Hidden Structure</b><br>The single biggest JEE cluster in this chapter, roughly a third of the question bank. The matrix always carries a concealed property (<i>A</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>I</i>, nilpotence, a rotation angle, cube roots of unity) and you are asked for <i>A</i><sup>31</sup>, <i>A</i><sup>50</sup>, one entry of a high power, or a long sum. CBSE tests the matrix-polynomial identity <i>f</i>(<i>A</i>) = <i>O</i> and reads <i>A</i><sup>−1</sup> straight off it. Brute force is always the intended wrong path."
