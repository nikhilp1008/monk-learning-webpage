/**
 * Chapter 08 · Mechanical Properties of Solids. Physics, Class 11.
 *
 * Restructured from pages 537 to 590 of the Drona Class 11 Physics Master
 * Reference (Chapter 8: Elasticity/Stress/Strain, Elastic Moduli, Poisson's
 * Ratio and Elastic Energy, Ductility/Malleability/Yielding, Applications of
 * Elastic Behaviour) into the block system in
 * design_handoff_textbooks/CONTENT_SPEC.md and lib/textbooks.ts, matching the
 * voice and density of phy-11-02-motion-straight-line.ts.
 *
 * FIVE TOPICS, BECAUSE THE SOURCE HAS FIVE SUBTOPICS. Pages 537 to 577 carry
 * exactly five, each on the same rigid eight-section template, and they map
 * 1:1 onto the five topics below. Nothing was merged, split or invented to
 * hit a count. The Round 2 Addendum (pages 578 to 590: A the master
 * elongation integral, B thermal stress with gaps and dissimilar rods, C the
 * wire-as-spring set in motion, D two wires sharing a load through a rigid
 * bar, E the interatomic potential made quantitative, F error propagation in
 * Searle's experiment) is explicitly not a topic per the brief. Every line
 * drawn from it below sits in a `protip`, a `mistakes` item or the hardest
 * `ex` of a group: A into Topic 01's integration material, C into Topic 02's
 * spring material and Topic 03's sudden-loading material, D into Topic 02's
 * combinations material, B and F into Topic 05's thermal-stress and Searle
 * material, E into Topic 05's atomic-origin material. No `formula`,
 * `defgrid`, `deriv` or `proc` block below is sourced from the addendum.
 * 54 pages is the shortest chapter in this wave; at 132 blocks over five
 * topics (26.4 per topic) the density matches phy-11-02's own (23.4) and
 * math-12-01-relations.ts's (23.5) without padding.
 *
 * ERRATA REVIEWED (source pages 977 to 981, all seven listed chapters read in
 * full). EXACTLY ONE ENTRY TOUCHES THIS RANGE:
 *
 *   - Page 980, "Chapter 8: Mechanical Properties of Solids". The printed
 *     text of Subtopic 05's MCQ Q2 (the mountain-height question, source page
 *     575) reads "a quick dimension check ($[ ]/[ g] = $ metres) rules them
 *     out instantly", with literal $ delimiters and empty brackets where the
 *     symbols died. The errata's first proposed fix is right and is what this
 *     chapter teaches: [σ]/([ρ][g]) = metres. Its SECOND proposed fix, and
 *     its gloss, are wrong for this chapter, and that is recorded below under
 *     CORRECTIONS BEYOND THE ERRATA.
 *
 * CORRECTIONS BEYOND THE ERRATA. Every worked example, every practice answer
 * and every MCQ key in Subtopics 01 to 05 was recomputed independently, as
 * were all twelve addendum worked examples and all twenty-four addendum
 * practice answers. The arithmetic is clean: no printed numerical answer is
 * wrong. Four non-numerical defects were found and are corrected in the
 * content below:
 *
 *   1. Errata page 980 offers, as an alternative fix, "√(σ/(ρg)) has units of
 *      length", and explains the passage as "a dimensional-analysis check on
 *      a capillary-rise-style formula". Both are wrong here. In Chapter 8 σ
 *      is a breaking STRESS, [M L−1 T−2], not a surface tension, [M T−2].
 *      Working: σ/(ρg) = [M L−1 T−2] / ([M L−3][L T−2]) = [M L−1 T−2] /
 *      [M L−2 T−2] = [L]. So σ/(ρg) is ALREADY a length and the square root
 *      would give [L^1/2], which is not a length at all. The root form is
 *      correct only for surface tension, where σ/(ρg) = [M T−2]/[M L−2 T−2] =
 *      [L2]. The errata has imported Chapter 9's capillary formula into
 *      Chapter 8's mountain-height MCQ. Topic 05's MCQ 2 below prints the
 *      un-rooted form and its nudges say why the root is wrong.
 *   2. Subtopic 01, Section 2 and its Cheat Sheet define the bulk modulus as
 *      "B = −P/(ΔV/V)". The numerator must be a CHANGE in pressure, ΔP: the
 *      chapter's own Subtopic 02 Example 1 uses B = −ΔP/(ΔV/V) and could not
 *      have got −0.50 cm³ otherwise, since it substitutes the 7.0 × 10^7 Pa
 *      excess, not an absolute pressure. Printed as B = −ΔP/(ΔV/V)
 *      throughout below.
 *   3. Subtopic 01, Example 3 closes "both pieces happen to stretch equally
 *      because their LY/A-balances coincide". The quantity that coincides is
 *      AY/L, not LY/A: steel has AY/L = (1.0 × 10−6)(2.0 × 10^11)/1.0 = 2.0 ×
 *      10^5 N/m and copper (2.0 × 10−6)(1.0 × 10^11)/1.0 = 2.0 × 10^5 N/m,
 *      which is the equality of the two SPRING CONSTANTS k = YA/L. With the
 *      printed LY/A the steel value is 1.0/(1.0 × 10−6) × 2.0 × 10^11 = 2 ×
 *      10^17 and the copper 5 × 10^16, which are not equal, so the printed
 *      sentence contradicts its own example. Topic 01's Example 3 below says
 *      "equal AY/L".
 *   4. Addendum C, Practice 2 asks the reader to prove that h = 0 gives x =
 *      2Mg/k and prints the step "½kx² = Mgx ⇒ x(k/2 − Mg) = 0". That bracket
 *      is dimensionally impossible: k/2 is N/m and Mg is N. The factorisation
 *      is x(½kx − Mg) = 0, whose non-trivial root is x = 2Mg/k. The printed
 *      root is right; only the middle line is mistyped. Topic 03's `protip`
 *      states the correct factorisation.
 *
 * SOURCE DAMAGE. Three of the brief's patterns are present in pages 537 to
 * 590; one is not, and one new one is. Every instance was re-authored from
 * context and never transcribed.
 *
 *   - GREEK SURVIVES, BUT AS FORBIDDEN GLYPHS. The brief warns that Greek is
 *     dropped without a placeholder. In this range it is not dropped: it
 *     arrives as Mathematical Italic characters in U+1D400 to U+1D7FF, 2830
 *     of them across the 54 pages (σ, ε, ν, η, φ, Δ, ρ, α, γ, λ, ω, θ, π, κ,
 *     μ, β, plus every italic Latin variable). The validator rejects that
 *     block and the app renders it as tofu, so not one character of the
 *     source's mathematics can be copied. Every symbol below is retyped as
 *     plain Unicode Greek (U+0370 block) or as <i>x</i>.
 *   - MULTIPLICATION SIGNS DIE AS "{nN". Eight occurrences, all in Subtopic
 *     01's Example 1 (source page 542): "2.0 mm2 = 2.0 {nN 10 −6 m2",
 *     "F = Mg = 8.0 {nN 10 = 80 N", "= 240 / 1.2 {nN 10 −9",
 *     "Y = 2.0 {nN 10 11 Pa". Each "{nN" is a × sign. Same family as the
 *     brief's "\n7" minus sign in the pilot, different glyph. Recomputed:
 *     Y = (80)(3.0)/((2.0 × 10−6)(6.0 × 10−4)) = 240/(1.2 × 10−9) = 2.0 ×
 *     10^11 Pa, which is the textbook value for steel, so the reconstruction
 *     is self-checking.
 *   - SUPERSCRIPTS LAND ON THEIR OWN LINES, pervasively, and this chapter's
 *     exponents run from 10−12 (r⁴ for a 1 mm wire) to 10^11 (Young's moduli)
 *     and 10^16 (σy² in the resilience example). Every exponent below was
 *     rebuilt by recomputing the example it sits in. The worst case,
 *     Subtopic 05 Example 4, extracts "𝑟 4 = (0.020) 4 = 1.6 × 10 −7 m 4":
 *     that is r⁴ = (0.020 m)⁴ = 1.6 × 10⁻⁷ m⁴, confirmed by C = πηr⁴θ/(2L) =
 *     π(4.0 × 10^10)(1.6 × 10−7)(0.50)/2 = 5.0 × 10³ N m as printed.
 *   - INTER-WORD SPACES VANISH at tight kerning, throughout. Confirmed
 *     instances used or paraphrased below: "Steel ismore elastic than rubber"
 *     (p.539), "samepull" (p.539), "itdoesnotdepend" and "notdepend" (p.541),
 *     "hasnosingle bulk modulus" (p.554), "isgraduallyincreased" (p.560),
 *     "itcannotexpand" (p.572), "volumeincreasesslightly" (p.555),
 *     "alsothinner" (p.555), "anelastomer" (p.563), "thesamethermal stress"
 *     (p.572), "thisisHooke's law" (p.572), "doesnotobey Hooke's law"
 *     (p.568), "thepracticalrange" (p.560), "sameinter-atomic bonds" (p.549),
 *     "togetherthey're treated as one" (p.565), "reasoningon stress-strain
 *     graphs" (p.562), "mountainheight" (p.575), "hethinner upper wire"
 *     (p.552, "the thinner"), "twicethe energy" (p.552),
 *     "independentproperties" (p.567), "straingraph" and "straincurve"
 *     (p.556, p.560).
 *   - NOT PRESENT: no ASCII-shifted heading run. The +29 pattern that decodes
 *     "$GGHQGXP$" to "AddendumA" does not appear anywhere in 537 to 590; the
 *     only two literal $ characters in the range are the leaked LaTeX the
 *     errata names. No U+20D7 combining arrow either, which is expected:
 *     this chapter has no vectors.
 *
 * DIMENSIONS. Every formula printed below, reduced to M L T. Stress is
 * [M L−1 T−2] and strain is [M0 L0 T0], so every modulus must come out
 * [M L−1 T−2]; all four that should, do.
 *
 *   - σ = F/A: [M L T−2]/[L2] = [M L−1 T−2]. ✓ Pa.
 *   - ε = Δx/x, ΔV/V, φ = x/h: [L]/[L] = 1. ✓ dimensionless, and this is the
 *     pair the brief flags, since σ and P share Pa while ε carries nothing.
 *   - σ = Eε: [M L−1 T−2] = [E]·1, so [E] = [M L−1 T−2]. ✓
 *   - Y = FL/(AΔL) = MgL/(πr2ΔL): [M L T−2][L]/([L2][L]) = [M L−1 T−2]. ✓
 *   - B = −ΔP/(ΔV/V): [M L−1 T−2]/1 = [M L−1 T−2]. ✓
 *   - compressibility k = 1/B: [M−1 L T2], i.e. Pa−1. ✓
 *   - η = τ/φ: [M L−1 T−2]/1 = [M L−1 T−2]. ✓
 *   - ν = −(Δr/r)/(ΔL/L): dimensionless. ✓
 *   - Y = 2η(1 + ν) = 3B(1 − 2ν): [M L−1 T−2] on all three sides, since ν is
 *     a pure number. ✓
 *   - 9/Y = 1/B + 3/η: every term [M−1 L T2]. ✓
 *   - ν = (3B − 2η)/(2(3B + η)): a ratio of like quantities, dimensionless. ✓
 *   - spring constant k = YA/L: [M L−1 T−2][L2]/[L] = [M T−2] = N/m. ✓
 *   - 1/keq = Σ1/ki and keq = Σki: [M−1 T2] and [M T−2]. ✓
 *   - Yeq = 2Y1Y2/(Y1 + Y2): [M L−1 T−2]. ✓ (harmonic mean of like terms)
 *   - ΔV/V = −ΔP/B and Δρ/ρ = +ΔP/B: dimensionless. ✓
 *   - Biso = P, Badia = γP: [M L−1 T−2], γ being a pure ratio. ✓
 *   - ΔV/V = (1 − 2ν)ΔL/L: dimensionless. ✓
 *   - U = ½FΔL: [M L T−2][L] = [M L2 T−2]. ✓ J.
 *   - U = ½σεV: [M L−1 T−2][1][L3] = [M L2 T−2]. ✓
 *   - U = ½(YA/L)(ΔL)2: [M L−1 T−2][L2][L2]/[L] = [M L2 T−2]. ✓
 *   - u = ½σε = ½Yε2 = σ2/(2Y): [M L−1 T−2]. ✓ J/m3 reduces to M L−1 T−2,
 *     which is why an energy DENSITY and a stress share a unit.
 *   - uresilience = σy2/(2Y): [M2 L−2 T−4]/[M L−1 T−2] = [M L−1 T−2]. ✓
 *   - xmax = 2mgL/(YA): [M L T−2][L]/([M L−1 T−2][L2]) = [L]. ✓
 *   - ΔL = MgL/(2AY) = ρgL2/(2Y): [M L−3][L T−2][L2]/[M L−1 T−2] = [L]. ✓
 *   - ΔL = Mω2L2/(3AY): [M][T−2][L2]/([L2][M L−1 T−2]) = [L]. ✓
 *   - ΔL = ∫T(x)/(A(x)Y) dx: ([M L T−2]/([L2][M L−1 T−2]))·[L] = [L]. ✓
 *   - ΔL = FL/(πR1R2Y) (tapered rod): [M L T−2][L]/([L2][M L−1 T−2]) = [L].
 *     ✓ and R1R2 confirms the effective area is π√(R1R2)², a geometric mean.
 *   - ℓmax = σbreak/(ρg) and hmax = σmax/(ρg): [M L−1 T−2]/[M L−2 T−2] = [L].
 *     ✓ This is the ledger line that kills the errata's √ version.
 *   - x = F/(ηL) (sheared cube): [M L T−2]/([M L−1 T−2][L]) = [L]. ✓
 *   - δ = WL3/(3YIg) and WL3/(48YIg): [M L T−2][L3]/([M L−1 T−2][L4]) = [L].
 *     ✓ Ig = bd3/12 = [L4] and πr4/4 = [L4], an AREA moment, not [M L2].
 *   - σth = YαΔT: [M L−1 T−2][Θ−1][Θ] = [M L−1 T−2]. ✓ no L, as advertised.
 *   - Fth = YAαΔT: [M L−1 T−2][L2] = [M L T−2] = N. ✓
 *   - C = πηr4θ/(2L): [M L−1 T−2][L4]/[L] = [M L2 T−2] = N m. ✓ θ in radians
 *     is dimensionless, so a torque and an energy share dimensions here and
 *     are told apart by what they multiply, not by their units.
 *   - torsional rigidity c = C/θ: [M L2 T−2]. ✓
 *   - T = 2π√(ML/(YA)): √([M][L]/([M L−1 T−2][L2])) = √([T2]) = [T]. ✓
 *   - κ = d2U/dr2 at r0: [M L2 T−2]/[L2] = [M T−2] = N/m, a spring constant.
 *     ✓ and ω = √(κ/μ) gives √([M T−2]/[M]) = [T−1]. ✓
 *   - δY/Y = δM/M + δL/L + 2δr/r + δ(ΔL)/ΔL: every term is a quantity over
 *     itself, so the whole line is dimensionless. ✓
 *
 *   40 formula lines checked, 40 dimensionally consistent. No dropped term
 *   found by this route.
 *
 * PHYSICAL PLAUSIBILITY AND LIMITING CASES. Poisson's ratio is between 0 and
 * 0.5 in every example (0.25, 0.29, 0.30, 0.34, and the 2/7 = 0.286 that
 * B = 2η forces); the one value outside is the theoretical lower bound −1,
 * which is taught as a bound and never used as a number. Young's modulus for
 * steel comes out 2.0 × 10^11 Pa from Topic 01's Example 1 data, which is the
 * check the source itself makes. Every strain in every worked example is
 * small: the largest anywhere in Topics 01 to 03 is 1.0 × 10−3, and the
 * elastic-region strains sit near 10−4, exactly as an elastic problem
 * demands. The one large strain in the chapter is deliberate and labelled: an
 * elastomer at 400 percent strain in Topic 04's Figure 8.2, which is not an
 * elastic-limit calculation but the whole reason rubber gets its own name.
 * Limiting cases used pedagogically: as the deforming force goes to zero,
 * every modulus stays FINITE, because a modulus is the slope of the
 * stress-strain line at the origin and not a value at the origin, which is
 * Topic 01's `def` on what a modulus is and Topic 02's answer to "does a
 * lightly loaded wire have a smaller Y". ν → 0.5 collapses ΔV/V to zero
 * (incompressible), ν → 0 collapses it to ΔL/L (no lateral contraction);
 * B → ∞ is the same limit from the other side. h → 0 in Topic 03's drop
 * equation returns the chapter's own xmax = 2xstatic. R1 = R2 in the tapered
 * rod returns the uniform-wire result. a → 0 in the lift-cable practice
 * returns the static tension.
 *
 * SEAMS: what is quoted as already known, and from which file.
 *   - phy-11-05-work-energy-power.ts, Topic 02: "DERIVATION · WHY A SPRING
 *     STORES ½kx²" and "FIGURE 4 · SPRING ENERGY IS THE TRIANGLE", plus that
 *     file's Topic 01 "FIGURE 3 · THE AREA UNDER F-x IS THE WORK" and its
 *     `formula` W = ∫F dx. Topic 03's elastic-energy derivation below names
 *     this and reuses it rather than re-deriving that the area under a
 *     linearly rising force is half base times height. It is the same
 *     triangle with F = (YA/L)ΔL in place of F = kx, and the chapter says so.
 *   - phy-11-05-work-energy-power.ts, Topic 03: conservation of mechanical
 *     energy. Topic 03's sudden-loading example equates lost gravitational
 *     PE to stored elastic PE and quotes the ledger rather than justifying
 *     it.
 *   - phy-11-04-laws-of-motion.ts: equilibrium of a hanging mass, so
 *     "the stretching force is Mg" in Topic 01's Derivation 1 is quoted, not
 *     argued. Also the free-body habit of naming a tension before writing an
 *     equation, used in Topic 02's series-wire example.
 *   - phy-11-02-motion-straight-line.ts, Topic 02: area under a graph as a
 *     running total, and Topic 05's introduction of integration as the power
 *     rule run backward. Topics 01, 03 and 05 below integrate three times
 *     (self-weight, elastic energy, torsion) and lean on that framing rather
 *     than teaching integration again. Class 11 Mathematics does not reach
 *     integration at all (checked: math-11-12-limits.ts is derivatives only),
 *     so this is the only place the idea has been introduced.
 *   - math-11-12-limits.ts, Topic 05: the power rule, used unremarked in
 *     Topic 05's atomic-potential derivation.
 *
 * FIGURES. Eight `diagram` blocks, all `plot`, carrying sixteen chips. Two
 * are the source's own named figures (8.1 the stress-strain curve, 8.2 the
 * three-material comparison); the other six were designed here, because the
 * source names only two figures in 54 pages. None dropped, no new figure
 * vocabulary requested. The panel rule is honoured everywhere: the three
 * moduli are three CHIPS of one block, never three panels in one frame, and
 * so are the two loading histories and the two energy areas.
 *
 * One scale problem is worth recording, because it recurs in any real
 * stress-strain figure. A steel wire yields at a strain near 0.002 and
 * fractures near 0.25, so the elastic region is under one percent of the
 * width of an honest full-range plot and simply cannot be seen. Printed
 * textbooks solve this by breaking the strain axis, which this vocabulary
 * cannot draw. Rather than label a stretched axis with numbers that are not
 * true, Figures 8.1 and the resilience/toughness pair each use TWO CHIPS with
 * two different honest windows: one zoomed to the elastic strains (x to
 * 0.0026) and one at full range (x to 0.28), with the caption saying so. Both
 * carry real numbers on both axes, so the slope of the first chip really is
 * 2 × 10^11 Pa and reads as Young's modulus.

CBSE Boards reliably ask a 2 to 3 mark definition or a Young's-modulus numerical, plus a stress-strain graph question. JEE Main almost always carries one question: an elongation, wires in series or parallel, or a graph reading. NEET asks about one, usually conceptual (<i>which is more elastic?</i>) or a breaking-stress numerical. JEE Advanced rarely tests this alone; it bundles it with thermal stress, rotation, or energy methods.<br><br><b>02 · The Elastic Moduli, and Wires as Springs</b><br>A workhorse. JEE Main loves the wire-as-a-spring idea and series or parallel combinations, roughly one question every year. NEET favours bulk-modulus and compressibility numericals and <i>which modulus applies</i> conceptuals. JEE Advanced reaches for the relations between <i>Y</i>, <i>B</i>, η and ν, and for the process-dependent bulk modulus of a gas. CBSE Boards ask a 2 to 3 mark bulk-modulus or shear-modulus numerical.<br><br><b>03 · Poisson's Ratio and the Energy a Stretch Stores</b><br>CBSE Boards reliably ask the <i>derivation</i> of the elastic potential energy of a stretched wire, worth 3 marks, and a definition of Poisson's ratio. JEE Main mixes the volume-change relation with Young's modulus and tests energy density. NEET favours the <i>area under the stress-strain curve</i> conceptual and quick energy-density numericals. JEE Advanced loves the sudden-loading energy partition, where half the work turns to heat.<br><br><b>04 · Ductile, Brittle, and the Yield Point</b><br>Heavy on conceptual and graph-reading questions. CBSE Boards ask definitions (ductile, brittle, elastomer, yield point) and a stress-strain interpretation. NEET reliably puts up a two-curve comparison: <i>which material is more brittle, which has the greater Young's modulus?</i> JEE Main tests yield-strength design and energy-to-yield. JEE Advanced reaches for multi-statement reasoning on stress-strain graphs and for elastic-hysteresis energy loss.<br><br><b>05 · Elasticity at Work</b><br>CBSE Boards regularly ask the I-section reasoning, the mountain-height estimate, and Searle's experiment, worth 3 to 5 marks. JEE Main tests beam depression and thermal-stress numericals. NEET favours thermal stress and the conceptual beam-design questions. JEE Advanced reaches for the torsion of a cylinder and for multi-concept thermal-stress problems. This subtopic ties the whole chapter together."
