/**
 * Chapter 08 · Application of Integrals, Mathematics, Class 12.
 *
 * Restructured from the Drona Class 12 Mathematics Master Reference (pages 496
 * to 542) into the block system in design_handoff_textbooks/CONTENT_SPEC.md,
 * matching the voice and density of math-12-01-relations.ts. The catalogue
 * calls this chapter "Application of Integrals", singular; the source's own
 * cover page agrees, and the plural belongs to Chapter 6.
 *
 * Editorial decisions worth recording:
 *
 * 1. SIX TOPICS, from a 47-page source that is three subtopics plus a
 *    six-part Round 2 Addendum. Subtopics 01 to 03 (pages 496 to 522) become
 *    topics 01 to 03 unchanged: one curve, two curves, and boundaries that
 *    have to be decoded. Addendum A (conic segments, pages 523 to 526) is
 *    substantial enough to be topic 04 on its own, and it is the pattern the
 *    boards actually set. The last two topics each fold two addenda, because
 *    neither half is a topic by itself: topic 05 is Addendum B (parametric
 *    curves) with Addendum C (inverse functions and the mirror), joined by the
 *    one idea they share, which is that you stop trying to write y as a
 *    function of x and change what you integrate in. Topic 06 is Addendum E
 *    (multi-hump periodic areas) with Addendum D (the area is given, find the
 *    parameter), joined by being the two questions the chapter's own closing
 *    note admits its text never models. Addendum P is not a topic: its
 *    distribution table feeds the hook, its eight archetypes feed the worked
 *    examples across all six topics, and its eight named traps feed the
 *    `mistakes` cards.
 *
 * 2. TWELVE DIAGRAMS, more than any chapter so far, because every worked area
 *    problem in this source is a picture of a shaded region and a student who
 *    cannot see the region cannot choose the limits. What each one shows:
 *
 *      T1 "THE ELEMENTARY STRIP": one strip, then the whole region, then a
 *        curve that crosses the axis so the two signed pieces visibly
 *        disagree, then a region walled by the y-axis that wants dy strips.
 *      T1 "SYMMETRY, AND THE CAP": the quarter circle you actually integrate,
 *        the ×4, the ellipse as a squashed circle, and the cap beyond a chord.
 *      T2 "THE LIMITS ARE THE INTERSECTIONS": the two curves alone, the lens,
 *        one strip running from the lower curve to the upper, and the same
 *        picture with a guessed upper limit of 2, where the shaded piece past
 *        the crossing is subtracting rather than adding. That fourth frame is
 *        the argument for solving f = g before writing any integral.
 *      T2 "WHEN THE CEILING CHANGES": the composite region, the switch line,
 *        the Advanced 2018 region whose ceiling changes from x² to 8/x, and a
 *        region that needs two integrals in x and one in y. The brief calls
 *        this the single most useful figure in the chapter and it is.
 *      T3 "CORNERS AND SIDES": the V, a shifted V drawn as its two straight
 *        pieces, the diamond as a genuine four-cornered polygon, and the wedge
 *        y ≥ |x| cut out of a disc.
 *      T3 "DECODE THE SET-BUILDER": one inequality at a time, then the
 *        overlap, then a modulus ceiling over a parabola floor.
 *      T4 "A CHORD CUTS A PARABOLA": the latus-rectum segment, Archimedes'
 *        triangle inside it, a horizontal chord on a downward parabola, and
 *        the half-answer that comes from drawing only the upper branch.
 *      T4 "A LINE CUTS A CIRCLE, AND AN ELLIPSE": the cap, the two lengths in
 *        the segment formula, the ellipse cap, and the same ellipse scaled
 *        onto its auxiliary circle.
 *      T5 "CURVES YOU CANNOT SOLVE FOR y": the astroid, the astroid inside
 *        its circle, one cycloid arch, and the arch inside its bounding
 *        rectangle, which is where the 3/4 comes from.
 *      T5 "THE MIRROR IN y = x": a function and its inverse, the lens between
 *        them, and the diagonal cutting the lens into two congruent halves.
 *      T6 "COUNT THE HUMPS": one arch, two humps that cancel, five half-arches
 *        over [0, 5π/2], and sine against cosine with both crossings marked.
 *      T6 "SLIDE THE LINE UNTIL THE HALVES MATCH": three positions of y = k on
 *        the same parabolic region, only one of which bisects it.
 *
 *    Two rendering notes, both forced by the vocabulary rather than chosen.
 *    `DiagramFrame.areas` fills between curves by evaluating them as functions
 *    of x, and `circle`, `ellipse` and the sideways `parabola` have no such
 *    evaluation, so a circular or elliptical region cannot be filled with
 *    `areas` at all. Every conic region here is therefore filled with
 *    `polygons`, sampled finely along the arc (every 9 to 15 degrees, or every
 *    0.25 in y for a parabola) with `corners: false`, which is exact to well
 *    under a pixel at 316pt and needs no new kind. The same technique draws the astroid and the
 *    cycloid, which have no `PlotCurve` at all. Second: `abs` is a|x| with no
 *    horizontal shift, so y = |x − 2| is drawn as its two straight pieces.
 *
 *    Nothing was dropped for want of a figure. The one thing worth naming as
 *    absent is |sin x|, which is not expressible (there is no modulus of a
 *    curve), so the periodic figure shades sin x hump by hump instead, which
 *    is the better teaching picture anyway because the cancellation is visible.
 *
 * 3. THE CONICS ARE NOT RE-TAUGHT. y² = 4ax, x²/a² + y²/b² = 1 and
 *    x² + y² = a² are quoted as known from math-11-10-conics.ts, along with
 *    the latus rectum, the auxiliary circle and the b/a squash. What is new
 *    here is the area between them, and Lemma A.2's scaling argument, which is
 *    the auxiliary-circle picture doing work Class 11 never asked of it.
 *
 * ERRATA (source pages 830 to 832): the errata lists five entries, for
 * Chapters 1, 3 and 11, and NONE for Chapter 8. So nothing was applied, and
 * everything below was found by re-solving the chapter.
 *
 * CORRECTIONS BEYOND THE ERRATA. Every area the book prints was recomputed.
 * Four printed claims are wrong; the corrected version is what this chapter
 * teaches, and each is taught as the mistake it is rather than silently fixed.
 *
 *   - Pages 529 to 530, Example C.1: "the area bounded by y = sin⁻¹x,
 *     y = cos⁻¹x and the x-axis" is printed as π/2 + 1 − √2 ≈ 1.157. The
 *     region is misidentified. The closed region bounded by exactly those
 *     three curves runs along y = sin⁻¹x from (0, 0) up to the crossing at
 *     (1/√2, π/4), back down y = cos⁻¹x to (1, 0), and home along the x-axis:
 *     it is the region under the LOWER of the two curves, and horizontal
 *     strips give its area in one line, ∫₀^{π/4} (cos y − sin y) dy =
 *     [sin y + cos y]₀^{π/4} = √2 − 1 ≈ 0.414. Vertical strips agree:
 *     ∫₀^{1/√2} sin⁻¹x dx + ∫_{1/√2}^1 cos⁻¹x dx = (π/(4√2) + 1/√2 − 1) +
 *     (1/√2 − π/(4√2)) = √2 − 1. The book integrates the UPPER curve on each
 *     side instead, which measures a different region, one whose boundary also
 *     needs the y-axis and the line x = 1 and so is not the region stated.
 *     Its own numerical check ("a sliver of width 1 and average height a bit
 *     over 1") describes that other region, so the slip is in the picture, not
 *     the arithmetic. Taught here as the corrected value, with the book's
 *     region shown alongside as the trap.
 *   - Page 525, Example A.1: for the area bounded by y² = 4x and its latus
 *     rectum the book warns that "doubling the area under the upper branch
 *     above the axis would be wrong, that computes a different region". It is
 *     not wrong; it is exactly right. The region is symmetric about the
 *     x-axis, the upper half is ∫₀¹ 2√x dx = 4/3, and doubling gives 8/3,
 *     which is the book's own answer on the next line. The real trap, named
 *     correctly one page earlier in the commentary on Lemma A.3, is forgetting
 *     to double and reporting 4/3. This chapter teaches doubling as the fast
 *     route and reports 4/3 as the trap.
 *   - Page 537, Addendum P, Archetype 2 header: "the twin parabolas y² = 4ax,
 *     x² = ay ... they meet at (0, 0) and (a, a); area = a²/3". Not for those
 *     two curves. Substituting y = x²/a into y² = 4ax gives x⁴ = 4a³x, so
 *     x = ∛4·a and y = ∛16·a, and the enclosed area is 4a²/3, not a²/3. The
 *     printed meeting point and area belong to y² = ax with x² = ay. The
 *     chapter's own Theorem 2 on page 508 is correct and different again:
 *     y² = 4ax with x² = 4ay enclose 16a²/3. All three pairs are quoted
 *     separately in topic 02 so the three answers cannot be confused.
 *   - Page 538, Addendum P, Archetype 5: the Main 2016 region
 *     {y² ≥ 2x, x² + y² ≤ 4x, x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0} is described as "inside the
 *     circle, right of the parabola". y² ≥ 2x is x ≤ y²/2, which is OUTSIDE
 *     the rightward parabola, on its left, and the book's own decode table on
 *     page 516 says so. The integral that follows is right and the answer
 *     π − 8/3 stands; only the stated side is wrong. It is quoted here with
 *     the side corrected, because a student who copies the sentence will
 *     shade the complementary region and get 8/3 − π + 2π, not π − 8/3.
 *
 * PRINTED PASSAGES THAT SELF-CORRECT (not errors in any answer, but not
 * reproducible as printed either): page 535's brute-force check on
 * ∫|sin x − cos x| claims the piece past 5π/4 repeats the piece before π/4,
 * then visibly recomputes it as 1 + √2 and arrives at the correct 4√2; and
 * page 536's practice answer 5 writes "3 × 2 = 6… careful" before settling on
 * the correct 3. Both are re-authored here from the corrected line only.
 *
 * PDF EXTRACTION DAMAGE, re-authored rather than guessed: the extractor turns
 * the minus sign into "{n7", × into "{nN" and a few italic letters into "{nA"
 * throughout pages 504 to 521; the numbered pitfall lists on pages 504, 505,
 * 513 and 521 come out with their headings shuffled to the foot of the page;
 * the figure caption on page 516 arrives Caesar-shifted ("OHIW DQG D
 * GLHUHQW FXUYH" is "left and a different curve"); and page 505's fifth
 * pitfall loses its own formulas ("It is (product of the semi-axes), not 22,
 * not (+)"), which is πab, not πa²b², not π(a + b). None of this is
 * mathematics and none of it is reproduced.
 *
 * A MARKUP NOTE: components/textbook/markup.tsx has no raised solidus, so a
 * fractional exponent such as x^(2/3) would degrade to baseline-height text
 * reading "x2/3". The astroid is therefore written with cube roots,
 * ∛(x²) + ∛(y²) = ∛(a²), which is the same curve and renders correctly.

CBSE Boards almost always carry one 3 or 5 mark question here, most often <b>“find the area of a circle or an ellipse by integration”</b>, which is a proof you can rehearse to the last line. JEE Main reliably places one question per paper, usually disguised as a region bounded by a curve and an axis, and the whole difficulty is choosing <i>dx</i> or <i>dy</i>. JEE Advanced rarely asks a pure one-curve question but builds every harder area on this skill, so a shaky foundation here costs marks downstream. Not in NEET; the medical paper has no mathematics section.<br><br><b>02 · Area between Two Curves</b><br>The highest-yield idea in the chapter and the largest single block of the previous-year bank. CBSE almost always sets a 5 mark question, typically a line against a parabola or two parabolas. In the modern MCQ era essentially <b>every JEE Main session carries exactly one area question</b>, and it is usually this type. JEE Advanced intersects a curve with a circle, or with itself, and demands a split. Master “top minus bottom” and you own the chapter.<br><br><b>03 · Modulus, Inequalities and Composite Regions</b><br>The JEE layer, and the fastest-growing pattern in the bank: a region handed to you as a set, {(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) : …}, with two or three conditions. Main 2014, 2015, 2016, Jan 2020 and Sep 2020 all did exactly this. CBSE occasionally sets a modulus area such as <i>y</i> = |<i>x</i> − 2| for 3 marks. Nothing new is integrated here; the examiner is testing <b>decoding</b>, and almost every lost mark is a decoding error rather than a calculus one.<br><br><b>04 · Segments of Conics</b><br>What the boards actually ask when they say “area”. The parabola cut by its latus rectum, a circle cut by a chord, an ellipse cut by a line: all three are standard CBSE 5 mark questions and all three recur in Main. Advanced adds the extraneous-root check, since squaring manufactures intersections the curve does not have. Archimedes' 4/3 gives you a free check the syllabus never mentions.<br><br><b>05 · Parametric Curves and the Mirror in <i>y</i> = <i>x</i></b><br>Permanent JEE fixtures that the board text skips entirely. The astroid's 3π<i>a</i>²/8 and the cycloid arch's 3π<i>a</i>² are famous answers to curves you cannot solve for <i>y</i> at all. The inverse-function half is Main territory: areas built on sin<sup>−1</sup><i>x</i>, tan<sup>−1</sup><i>x</i>, ln <i>x</i> and cube roots, where one reflection halves the work.<br><br><b>06 · Periodic Regions, and Areas that Fix a Parameter</b><br>Two patterns the chapter's own closing note admits it under-serves. Trigonometric boundaries such as |cos <i>x</i> − sin <i>x</i>| were asked in Main 2013 and Advanced 2013, and blind integration across several periods guarantees a wrong answer. The reverse question, <b>the area is given and a coefficient is the unknown</b>, appears in Main 1999, 2004, 2011 and April 2019, ends in a cubic in the parameter, carries two valid answers as often as one, and is chronically under-practised."
