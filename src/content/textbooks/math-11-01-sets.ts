/**
 * Chapter 01 · Sets — Mathematics, Class 11.
 *
 * Restructured from the Drona Class 11 Mathematics Master Reference into the
 * block system in design_handoff_textbooks/CONTENT_SPEC.md. Editorially
 * finished; this is the shape every future chapter is generated into, so the
 * reader stays free of chapter-specific code.
 *
 * One edit against the handoff data: the writer authored a separate exam hook
 * for all five topics, but the reader only ever rendered topic 1's and threw
 * the other four away. Rather than lose four paragraphs of real exam guidance,
 * or open an accordion on every topic (which reads as repetition, not help),
 * all five are merged into the single hook at the top of topic 1, each under
 * its own topic heading.

CBSE Boards ask 1-mark roster/set-builder conversions and 1–2 mark empty/finite/infinite classification. In JEE Main, Sets rarely stands alone but the phrasing <b>“S is the set of all values of…”</b> hides inside dozens of algebra and calculus problems, fluency here saves time everywhere. JEE Advanced uses set language as a default dialect.<br><br><b>02 · Subsets, Power Set, and Universal Set</b><br>A perennial source of quick marks. CBSE asks 1–2 mark questions on listing subsets and the power set. JEE Main loves the one-line trap <b>“if n[P(A)] = 2<sup>k</sup>, find n(A)”</b> and subset-counting. The interval-as-subset idea is the silent backbone of every domain/range problem in calculus, so JEE Advanced assumes total fluency.<br><br><b>03 · Venn Diagrams and Set Operations</b><br>Bread-and-butter marks across every exam. CBSE asks 2–3 mark questions on computing <i>A</i> ∪ <i>B</i>, <i>A</i> ∩ <i>B</i>, <i>A</i> − <i>B</i>, <i>A</i>′ or shading a Venn diagram. JEE Main tests simplification and De Morgan’s laws, often disguised inside logic or probability. Operations on intervals are the silent machinery behind every domain-of-a-function problem in Advanced calculus.<br><br><b>04 · Cardinality of Unions and Practical Problems</b><br>One of the highest-yield, most predictable scoring topics in the whole chapter. CBSE almost always carries a 3–4 mark word problem on two or three sets. JEE Main features inclusion–exclusion standalone and woven into Probability. JEE Advanced pushes into fine partitions, <b>exactly one, exactly two, at least two</b>, and problems where the three-way overlap is the unknown.<br><br><b>05 · Indexed Families, Generalised Laws & Double Counting</b><br>CBSE asks 1–2 mark questions on indexed families, usually <i>A<sub>n</sub></i> as the multiples of <i>n</i>. JEE Main tests the notation on families of shrinking intervals, where <b>the whole mark rides on whether an endpoint is open or closed</b>. JEE Advanced draws on this twice: inclusion–exclusion for four or more sets, and the double-counting identity, a question type that has recurred for decades and collapses into two lines once you recognise it."
