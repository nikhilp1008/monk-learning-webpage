 * Chapter 04 · Determinants. Mathematics, Class 12.
 *
 * Restructured from pages 209 to 272 of the Drona Class 12 Mathematics Master
 * Reference into the block system in design_handoff_textbooks/CONTENT_SPEC.md,
 * following math-11-01-sets.ts and math-11-09-straight-lines.ts for voice and
 * density. Straight Lines is the direct neighbour: its area-of-a-triangle
 * formula is this chapter's Topic 03 determinant, expanded.
 *
 * The source is two documents stacked: a typeset chapter of six parts, and a
 * Round 2 Addendum of six lettered sections (A to E, plus P, an analysis of
 * what JEE actually asks). Six topics is the schema's ceiling, so the addendum
 * is folded into the part it belongs to rather than given topics of its own:
 *
 *   - Addendum A (circulant determinants and the cube roots of unity) sits in
 *     Topic 02. Stripped of the omega machinery, which is a Class 11 complex
 *     numbers detour, what remains is the column-sum move of Part 2 aimed at a
 *     recurring shape, plus the two shift signs and the cubic they produce.
 *   - Addendum D (concurrency, the family of lines, polygon areas) sits in
 *     Topic 03, which is where its parent formula lives. Its parallelism
 *     caution is carried in full: it is the only place the chapter admits a
 *     zero determinant can lie to you about geometry.
 *   - Addendum E (what to actually do when Δ = 0) sits in Topic 05, next to
 *     the consistency table it repairs, including the rank-1 counterexample
 *     that slips past the Δᵢ screen.
 *   - Addendum B (trigonometric determinants) and Addendum C (alternants with
 *     a missing power) sit in Topic 06, alongside Part 6's own multiplication,
 *     differentiation and special-determinant material.
 *   - Addendum P's distribution of the 1979 to 2020 question bank is folded
 *     into the exam hook, where a share-of-paper figure is worth more to a
 *     student than a list of years.
 *
 * Two deliberate omissions. The omega-machine derivation of the circulant
 * (Addendum A, Step 2) is dropped: it needs primitive cube roots of unity and
 * a simultaneous column change of basis, and it produces a factorisation the
 * chapter never uses, while the value it certifies is stated and checked.
 * Addendum P's counting and extremal genre (maximum determinant over entries
 * in {−1, 0, 1}, Hadamard bounds, trace puzzles solved by eigenvalues) is
 * dropped too: the source itself says the book never develops it, and it needs
 * machinery that is not in this chapter or the ones around it.
 *
 * Three errors in the source that the book's own errata does not cover. The
 * errata (pages 830 to 832) lists entries for Chapters 1, 3 and 11 and nothing
 * at all for Chapter 4, so all three are recorded here, and all three were
 * re-derived from scratch:
 *
 *   1. Addendum D, Practice 1 answer. For the lines 2x − 3y + 5 = 0,
 *      4x − 6y + 9 = 0 and 2x − 2y + 3 = 0 the printed key opens
 *      "Determinant = 0" and then works "2(−18+18) + 3(−12+18) + 5(−8+12) =
 *      0+18+20 ≠ 0", contradicting itself inside one sentence. The correct
 *      value is 2. The middle cofactor term is +3 × |4 9 ; 2 3| = 3(12 − 18) =
 *      −18, not +18, so the sum is 0 − 18 + 20 = 2. Confirmed independently by
 *      R₂ → R₂ − 2R₁, which leaves the row (0, 0, −1) and gives Δ = 2. The
 *      printed conclusion, "not concurrent", is right: the first two lines are
 *      parallel and distinct. Carried into Topic 03 as the parallelism caution
 *      rather than as a worked answer.
 *   2. Addendum C, Practice 3 answer. Fitting the quotient of
 *      |1 1 1 ; a² b² c² ; a³ b³ c³| by the Vandermonde, the key prints
 *      "11 = 18λ + 11μ" from the specialisation (1, 2, 3) and "Δ = 2 ... gives
 *      1 = 9λ + 2μ" from (0, 1, 2). The correct equations are 11 = 36λ + 11μ,
 *      since e₁² = (1 + 2 + 3)² = 36, and 2 = 9λ + 2μ, since the determinant at
 *      (0, 1, 2) is 4 and not 2. The printed pair solves to μ = 9/7, which
 *      contradicts the key's own stated answer; the corrected pair gives λ = 0
 *      and μ = 1, so the quotient is ab + bc + ca, which is what the key
 *      states and what the identity requires.
 *   3. Addendum C, Practice 2 answer. The padding argument is described as
 *      reading "the coefficient of x³ ... (sign (−1)^(4+4))". It is the
 *      coefficient of x², whose cofactor sign is (−1)^(3+4) = −1: deleting the
 *      row of squares from the padded 4 × 4 is what leaves the 1, a, a³
 *      alternant. Both readings of the coefficient then carry a minus and it
 *      cancels, so the key's value, Δ = (a + b + c)V₃ = 60, is correct.
 *
 * Four `diagram` blocks, all of kind `plot`, and no figure is forced: a
 * determinant is mostly algebra. Two ideas here are genuinely visual and the
 * plot draws both. Topic 02 uses `polygons` for the parallelogram the rows
 * span, which is what makes swap, scale, shear and proportional rows obvious
 * rather than memorised. Topic 03 uses `polygons` again for the area of a
 * triangle and for the collinear case flattened onto a line. Topics 03 and 05
 * use `line` curves for three lines meeting, running parallel, or coinciding,
 * which is concurrency and the consistency criterion drawn rather than
 * asserted. Everything else is a table, because a table is the honest form for
 * it. Diagram chips and captions render as plain text, not markup, so they
 * carry no inline tags.
 *
 * The exam hook is authored once, on topic 1, with a bold heading per topic,
 * because the reader renders `hook` only there. Same convention, and the same
 * reason, as the Sets and Straight Lines chapters.

CBSE asks direct 1 to 2 mark evaluations and “solve the determinant equation” problems. Every JEE Main and Advanced determinant question silently depends on fluent, error-free expansion, so a shaky expansion quietly costs you marks in five other topics.<br><br><b>02 · Properties, and Proving Without Expanding</b><br>The single most-used tool in the chapter: you simplify <b>before</b> you expand. CBSE almost always carries a 3 to 4 mark “prove without expanding” or “evaluate using properties” question. JEE Main poses 1 to 2 a paper on property-based factoring or fast evaluation, and across the 1979 to 2020 bank properties and factorisation are about a fifth of all determinant items. JEE Advanced folds them into multi-step manipulations with algebra, sequences or matrices.<br><br><b>03 · Area, Collinearity and Concurrency</b><br>A guaranteed CBSE scorer: 1 to 2 mark area or collinearity questions appear almost every year, and “find <i>k</i> so that the points are collinear” is a perennial. JEE Main hides it inside coordinate geometry and loci, roughly one item in twelve. The bookkeeping is the whole trap: drop the ½ or the modulus and both branches of an area equation collapse into one wrong answer.<br><br><b>04 · Minors, Cofactors and the Adjoint</b><br>The machinery the rest of the chapter runs on. CBSE asks a direct 1 to 2 mark “find the minor or cofactor of <i>a</i><sub><i>ij</i></sub>”, or “expand using cofactors”. JEE Main leans on cofactor expansion, the cross-cofactor-zero trick and |adj <i>A</i>| shortcuts, which together with the inverse identities carry about 15% of the bank. JEE Advanced pushes |adj <i>A</i>| = |<i>A</i>|<sup><i>n</i>−1</sup> into multi-step ladders.<br><br><b>05 · The Inverse and Systems of Equations</b><br>The payoff, and the largest single block in the exam bank: consistency of linear systems is roughly 35% of all determinant questions, and from 2017 onward most JEE Main papers carry two to four of them. CBSE almost always sets a 5 to 6 mark “solve the system by matrix method”. JEE Advanced favours homogeneous systems, the dimension of the solution space, and parameter-rich consistency analysis.<br><br><b>06 · Advanced Techniques</b><br>Pure JEE territory, and it rarely appears on CBSE at all. Multiplication and adjoint identities power the one-mark |2<i>AB</i>| traps. Elementwise scaling, differentiation of a determinant, trigonometric determinants and Vandermonde-style factorisation appear as full Advanced problems. Mastering these is the difference between a good score and a top percentile."
