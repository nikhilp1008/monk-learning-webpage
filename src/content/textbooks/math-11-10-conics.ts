 * Chapter 10 · Conic Sections. Mathematics, Class 11.
 *
 * Restructured from pages 780 to 877 of the Drona Class 11 Mathematics Master
 * Reference into the block system in design_handoff_textbooks/CONTENT_SPEC.md,
 * following math-11-01-sets.ts and math-11-03-trigonometry.ts for voice and
 * density.
 *
 * The source is three documents stacked: a typeset chapter of five units
 * (Introduction, The Circle, The Parabola, The Ellipse, The Hyperbola), a
 * Round 1 Supplement of four more (Parametric Forms and the Auxiliary Circle,
 * Tangents to a Conic, Normals to a Conic, Applied Problems) and a Round 2
 * Addendum of four lettered items (A the chord bisected at a point, B pole and
 * polar, C asymptotes as an object and the conjugate hyperbola, D families of
 * conics). Thirteen units into six topics, so the supplementary material is
 * folded into the curve it actually belongs to rather than given topics of its
 * own:
 *
 *   - The parametric forms are split across the curves they parametrise. The
 *     parabola's (at², 2at) sits in Topic 03, where the focal-chord condition
 *     t₁t₂ = −1 needs it; the ellipse's eccentric angle and auxiliary circle
 *     sit in Topic 04, where the b : a squash is the whole picture; the
 *     hyperbola's (a sec θ, b tan θ) sits in Topic 05 next to the identity
 *     sec²θ − tan²θ = 1 that forces it.
 *   - Applied Problems is an applications unit that introduces no formula of
 *     its own, so its four NCERT staples go to their curves: the parabolic
 *     reflector and the suspension cable into Topic 03, the semi-elliptical
 *     archway and the whispering gallery into Topic 04, the hyperbolic cooling
 *     tower into Topic 05. The one transferable skill it does carry, choosing
 *     where to put the origin, is stated once in Topic 03 and reused after.
 *   - Addendum D, the family S + λS′ = 0, sits in Topic 02, which is where the
 *     source says to read it and where the three-point circle it replaces was
 *     worked.
 *   - Addendum C, the asymptotes as a second-degree object and the conjugate
 *     hyperbola, sits in Topic 05 next to the limiting-slope derivation it
 *     completes.
 *   - Tangents, Normals and Addenda A and B are one topic, Topic 06. They are
 *     four questions about the same expression T, and separating them would
 *     teach the substitution rule four times.
 *
 * Two deliberate omissions, both from the Round 2 Addendum. The hyperbolic
 * alternative parametrisation (a cosh u, b sinh u) is dropped: the source
 * itself says it is worth recognising but that (a sec θ, b tan θ) is what CBSE
 * and JEE expect, and cosh has not been defined anywhere in Class 11. The
 * conjugate-diameter half of Addendum A is dropped for altitude, and the
 * bisected chord T = S₁ that it is built on is kept.
 *
 * The exam hook is authored once, on topic 1, with a bold heading per topic,
 * because the reader renders `hook` only there. Same convention, and the same
 * reason, as the Sets and Trigonometry chapters.
 *
 * Nine `diagram` blocks, all `plot`, which is the parameterised kind that draws
 * conics natively. Chips and captions render as plain text, not markup, so they
 * carry no inline tags. Two limits of the drawing vocabulary shaped the
 * figures: `parabola` takes no centre, so every parabola here is drawn at the
 * origin and the shifted-centre case is carried by the circle in Topic 02; and
 * `hyperbola` draws only the horizontal orientation, so the conjugate hyperbola
 * (which is vertical) is carried in prose and in the defgrid rather than drawn.
 * Frame windows keep an x-to-y range ratio near 1.4, which is the plot's own
 * aspect, so a circle reads as round.

JEE Main routinely hides one classification question inside the general second-degree equation. JEE Advanced expects fluency with the unifying eccentricity definition and with the discriminant test. Master this topic and the chapter stops being four disconnected curves and becomes one idea seen from four angles.<br><br><b>02 · The Circle</b><br>The most heavily examined conic at Board level, 2–4 marks for the equation, the centre or the radius. JEE Main carries 1–2 questions, usually the general-form centre and radius or the position of a point. JEE Advanced fuses it with tangent-length and locus reasoning, and with the family <i>S</i> + λ<i>S</i>′ = 0 that NCERT's own Historical Note names and then never uses.<br><br><b>03 · The Parabola</b><br>CBSE reliably asks 1–3 marks: read a standard equation and report focus, axis, directrix and latus rectum, or build the equation from given conditions. JEE Main carries 1–2 questions on standard-form manipulation plus the inside/outside test. JEE Advanced uses the parabola as a vehicle for focal-chord and reflection reasoning. The NCERT reflector and suspension-bridge problems are near-certain Board applications.<br><br><b>04 · The Ellipse</b><br>CBSE asks 1–4 marks, and the focal-sum derivation is a frequent long answer. JEE Main runs 1–2 questions on eccentricity and latus-rectum relationships. JEE Advanced builds whole problems on the auxiliary circle, because it converts ellipse geometry into circle geometry and circle geometry is easy. The semi-elliptical archway and the whispering gallery are the Board's favourite applications.<br><br><b>05 · The Hyperbola</b><br>CBSE asks 1–4 marks: foci, axes, eccentricity, latus rectum and asymptotes, and the difference-of-distances derivation is a recurring long answer. JEE Main asks about eccentricity and asymptote relationships. JEE Advanced treats the asymptotes as an object in their own right and adds the conjugate hyperbola. The hyperbolic cooling tower is the standard applied item.<br><br><b>06 · Tangents, Normals and the T-rule</b><br>The single highest-yield block in the chapter. JEE Main names the condition of tangency explicitly in its syllabus and asks it almost every session: for what <i>c</i> does the line touch, find the tangent of slope <i>m</i>, find the point of contact. CBSE asks the tangent and then the normal at a stated point for 2–4 marks. JEE Advanced pushes into the chord of contact, the pair of tangents <i>SS</i><sub>1</sub> = <i>T</i><sup>2</sup>, the director circle, the polar of a point, and the three-normals property <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>t</i><sub>2</sub> + <i>t</i><sub>3</sub> = 0."
