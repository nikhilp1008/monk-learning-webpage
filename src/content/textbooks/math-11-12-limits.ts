/**
 * Chapter 12 · Limits and Derivatives. Mathematics, Class 11.
 *
 * Restructured from pages 918 to 985 of the Drona Class 11 Mathematics Master
 * Reference into the block system in design_handoff_textbooks/CONTENT_SPEC.md,
 * following math-11-01-sets.ts and math-11-03-trigonometry.ts for voice and
 * density.
 *
 * The source is three documents stacked: a typeset chapter of five subtopics
 * plus a Master Reference; a Round 1 Supplement (subtopic 06, Advanced Limit
 * Techniques, plus Addendum A on functional equations and Addendum B on
 * differentiability at a junction); and a Round 2 Addendum (subtopic 07,
 * Limits of Sequences). Six topics is the schema's ceiling, so the
 * supplementary material is folded into the topic it actually belongs to
 * rather than given topics of its own:
 *
 *   - Subtopic 06's shift substitution, x = a + h with the trigonometric shift
 *     identities, sits inside Topic 03. Every junction in that topic carries
 *     the fine print "the argument must go to 0", and the shift exists for no
 *     other reason than to satisfy it. Separating them would teach half an
 *     idea twice.
 *   - Subtopic 06's L'Hopital rule and Maclaurin expansions sit inside Topic
 *     05. Both need a derivative before they can even be stated, and Topic 05
 *     is the first place in the chapter where differentiating is fast. It also
 *     stops that topic being a bare list of rules: the rules earn their keep
 *     by paying limits back.
 *   - Subtopic 06's x → −∞ sign rule and its 0 × ∞ conversion sit inside Topic
 *     06, beside the limits-at-infinity machinery they extend.
 *   - Addendum A and Addendum B sit inside Topic 04. The source labels both as
 *     extensions of subtopic 03, and both are the first principle applied in
 *     exactly the places where the differentiation rules have nothing to act
 *     on: no formula for f, or two formulas meeting at a junction.
 *   - Subtopic 07 sits inside Topic 06. A sequence limit is a limit at
 *     infinity taken by hopping instead of sliding, and the bridge theorem
 *     that makes most sequence questions tractable hands the work straight
 *     back to that topic's degree rule.
 *
 * One deliberate omission, for altitude. The source's Round 2 material on
 * recursively defined sequences is kept only as far as the order of the
 * argument (monotone, then bounded, then the fixed point); the full induction
 * proofs are JEE Advanced enrichment that would thin the other five topics to
 * fit, and the order is the part that is actually examined.
 *
 * Two errors in the source, corrected here:
 *
 *   1. Subtopic 04, Section 6, Q3. The gloss on distractor (D) 12 says the
 *      student "doubles correctly but forgets u = 1 and uses u = 2", but
 *      3 × 2² × 2 is 24, not 12. The reading that actually produces 12 is
 *      3u² = 3 × 2² with u taken as 2 AND the inner derivative dropped
 *      altogether, which is what the nudge in Topic 05 says instead.
 *   2. Round 2 Addendum, Section 6, Q1. The third option is printed "(B)",
 *      duplicating the second. It must be "(C)", as the source's own distractor
 *      analysis confirms by discussing an option (C) that no line offers.
 *
 * Eight `diagram` blocks: seven `plot` and one `numberline`. Two notes for
 * whoever edits them. Chips and captions render as plain text, not markup, so
 * they carry no inline tags. And the first curve of a frame is drawn in ink
 * and every later one in amber unless it is `soft`, so the order of `curves`
 * decides which curve the eye reads first.

          "html": "<b>01 · What a Limit Actually Is</b><br>This is the gateway to all of calculus, so its weight is felt everywhere. CBSE Boards ask a direct evaluation for 2 to 3 marks almost every year, and a “does the limit exist” one-sided question for 1 to 2. JEE Main carries 1 to 2 questions that are usually clean algebra of limits. JEE Advanced rarely asks it standing alone but assumes it silently inside continuity, differentiability and integration: get it shaky here and the whole calculus tower wobbles.<br><br><b>02 · Resolving the 0/0 Form</b><br>The most predictable board question in the chapter: a 0/0 rational limit cleared by factoring, or a surd cleared by its conjugate, lifted near-verbatim from NCERT for 2 to 3 marks. JEE Main runs the <b>“find <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> so that the limit is finite”</b> pattern most sessions, and the ratio form of the star limit is a ten-second question if you recognise it and a two-minute one if you do not.<br><br><b>03 · The Standard Limits</b><br>Guaranteed marks, and the highest-yield topic in the chapter. CBSE asks a direct trigonometric limit from the sin <i>x</i> / <i>x</i> family most years, and NCERT’s own exercise set carries lim<sub>x→π/2</sub> tan 2<i>x</i> / (<i>x</i> − π/2). JEE Main runs 1 to 2 every session, usually a junction disguised inside a larger expression, plus one 1<sup>∞</sup> problem. JEE Advanced assumes total fluency and never asks them nakedly.<br><br><b>04 · The Derivative from First Principle</b><br><b>“Find the derivative of <i>f</i> from first principle”</b> is a near-guaranteed CBSE question worth 2 to 3 marks every year. JEE Main tests the definition directly and disguised, as a difference quotient you are meant to recognise rather than expand. JEE Advanced leans on it for differentiability from the definition, for functional-equation problems where no formula exists to differentiate, and for the piecewise “find <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>” pattern.<br><br><b>05 · Rules of Differentiation</b><br>The computational engine. CBSE tests products and quotients directly for 3 to 4 marks. JEE Main uses these rules inside essentially every calculus question, and the single most punished slip in the paper is a dropped inner derivative. JEE Advanced assumes total fluency with the chain rule and expects the series expansions for higher-order 0/0 limits that nothing else cracks cleanly.<br><br><b>06 · Infinity, Jumps and Sequences</b><br>JEE Main reliably asks one limit-at-infinity question every session, and the sign trap in a surd as <i>x</i> → −∞ is one of the most dependable single-question traps in the paper. CBSE tests rational end behaviour and a greatest-integer or modulus existence case for 1 to 2 marks. JEE Advanced favours these inside assertion-reason and sandwich problems, and asks a sequence limit, usually a sum whose length grows, most years."
