/**
 * Chapter 04 · Complex Numbers and Quadratic Equations. Mathematics, Class 11.
 *
 * Restructured from pages 283–351 of the Drona Class 11 Mathematics Master
 * Reference into the block system in design_handoff_textbooks/CONTENT_SPEC.md,
 * matching the voice and density of math-11-01-sets.ts.
 *
 * Three decisions worth recording.
 *
 * 1. The source runs nine numbered subtopics: 01–06 in the main text, a
 *    Supplement (07, real quadratics) and two Round 2 Addenda (08,
 *    transformation of equations; 09, complex numbers as vectors). Nine
 *    sections would break the 4–6 topic rule and would also split material a
 *    student meets as one idea, so the addenda are folded in: 05 (Euler form,
 *    roots of unity) joins 03 as one polar-form topic, 09 joins 06 as one
 *    Argand-geometry topic, and 08 joins 07 as one real-quadratic topic. The
 *    result is six self-contained topics with nothing dropped except the
 *    source's own cross-references and diagnostic tags, which are authoring
 *    metadata rather than content.
 *
 * 2. The writer's per-subtopic exam guidance is merged into the single hook on
 *    topic 1, each under its own bold topic heading, for the same reason
 *    math-11-01-sets.ts does it: the reader renders `hook` on topic 1 only, and
 *    throwing five paragraphs of real exam guidance away is worse than one
 *    slightly long accordion.
 *
 * 3. No `diagram` blocks beyond one `numsys`. The reader implements six figure
 *    kinds and none of them is an Argand plane, so every figure this chapter
 *    actually wants (rotation, loci, roots of unity as a polygon, the parabola
 *    sign panels) would render as a silent hole. `numsys` earns its place once,
 *    where ℂ is introduced as the last enlargement of the number system, and
 *    the geometry is carried in prose, formulas and worked examples instead.

          "html": "<b>01 · Complex Numbers and the Algebra of i</b><br>This is the load-bearing wall of the chapter. CBSE Boards ask direct 1–2 mark questions: simplify a power of <i>i</i>, express a number in <i>a</i> + <i>ib</i> form, find <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> by equating real and imaginary parts, compute a multiplicative inverse. JEE Main assumes this fluency in every complex-number problem and tests it standalone through powers of <i>i</i> or a condition for a quotient to be purely real. JEE Advanced almost never tests it in isolation, but one slow arithmetic step here costs you time on the hard rotation problems.<br><br><b>02 · The Modulus and the Conjugate</b><br>The algebraic engine of the whole chapter. The single identity <b><i>z</i> <i>z̄</i> = |<i>z</i>|<sup>2</sup></b> is what turns “divide by a complex number” and “prove this is real” into ordinary real arithmetic. CBSE gives reliable 1–2 mark questions on conjugate, modulus and the inverse <i>z̄</i>/|<i>z</i>|<sup>2</sup>. JEE Main tests purely-real conditions, modulus of a product and modulus inequalities every single year. JEE Advanced assumes the property list is silent reflex.<br><br><b>03 · The Argand Plane, Polar Form and De Moivre</b><br>The single most leveraged idea in the chapter. CBSE asks 2–3 mark questions on polar form and the four-quadrant principal argument. JEE Main tests argument algebra, polar conversion and De Moivre powers every year, and Euler form with cube or fourth roots of unity most years. JEE Advanced treats the roots-of-unity toolkit as assumed knowledge, and many problems are simply unsolvable without it. The signature trap is reporting tan<sup>−1</sup>(<i>y</i>/<i>x</i>) without fixing the quadrant.<br><br><b>04 · Argand Geometry: Rotation, Loci and Vectors</b><br>Beyond Class 11 boards, so skip it if you are writing boards only. JEE Main uses distance, simple loci and basic rotation regularly, and hides the perpendicularity test inside “show these three points form a right-angled triangle” or “find the area of this triangle”. JEE Advanced treats this as core, high-yield ground: the rotation theorem, Apollonius circles, arg-loci, collinearity and modulus extrema on a locus.<br><br><b>05 · Quadratic Equations with Complex Roots</b><br>Where the first four topics pay off: the quadratic formula, which failed whenever the discriminant was negative, now succeeds for every quadratic. CBSE asks the staple solve-with-negative-discriminant question. JEE Main asks you to build a quadratic from a given complex root, to use the conjugate-root theorem, and to extract the square root of a complex number. JEE Advanced pushes into complex coefficients, where roots are <b>not</b> a conjugate pair.<br><br><b>06 · Real Quadratics: Sign, Location and Transformation</b><br>The most heavily examined material in the chapter. CBSE takes 2–4 marks on the nature of roots, the maximum or minimum of a quadratic expression, simple quadratic inequalities, and “form the equation whose roots are <i>α</i> + 2 and <i>β</i> + 2”. JEE Main draws two of its most reliable single-question patterns from here: the common root of two quadratics, and “find all parameter values for which <i>ax</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>bx</i> + <i>c</i> keeps one sign for every real <i>x</i>”, plus the transformation substitutions. JEE Advanced pushes into location of roots relative to a number or an interval, usually with one boundary case designed to be missed, and into Newton's power-sum recurrence."
