/**
 * Chapter 03 · Motion in a Plane. Physics, Class 11.
 *
 * Restructured from pages 131 to 193 of the Drona Class 11 Physics Master
 * Reference (Chapter 3: Vector Algebra and Resolution, Vector Products,
 * Two-Dimensional Kinematics, Projectile Motion, Relative Velocity in Two
 * Dimensions, Circular Motion Dynamics) into the block system in
 * design_handoff_textbooks/CONTENT_SPEC.md and lib/textbooks.ts, matching the
 * voice and density of phy-11-02-motion-straight-line.ts.
 *
 * SIX TOPICS, because the source has exactly six sub-topics in this range and
 * they map 1:1 onto the six below. Nothing was merged or split. The Round 2
 * Addendum (pages 181 to 193: A projectiles that do not land at launch level,
 * B the vertical circle, C banking with friction, D the river the boat cannot
 * beat plus closest approach by geometry) is not a topic, per the brief. Every
 * line drawn from it lives in a `protip`, a `mistakes` item, or the hardest
 * `ex`/`mcq` of the group it extends: A into Topic 04's projectile material,
 * B and C into Topic 06's circular-motion material, D into Topic 05's river
 * and closest-approach material. No `formula`, `defgrid`, `deriv`, `proc` or
 * `diagram` block below is sourced from the addendum.
 *
 * ERRATA REVIEWED (source pages 977 to 981, all five errata pages read in
 * full). NO ENTRY TOUCHES THIS RANGE. The list carries entries for Chapter 1
 * (SI adoption year), Chapter 2 (contents omission, a phantom MCQ option),
 * Chapter 4 (two duplicated option labels, one wrong key), Chapter 6 (a
 * metre-stick MCQ whose options miss the answer, a dropped mass factor in an
 * angular-momentum answer), Chapter 8 (leaked LaTeX), Chapter 9 (shifted part
 * labels) and Chapter 11 (a molar-quantity arithmetic error, CO2 misdescribed
 * as bent). Chapter 3 is absent from the list entirely, so nothing printed in
 * pages 131 to 193 was flagged by the publisher.
 *
 * CORRECTIONS BEYOND THE ERRATA. Every worked example, practice answer and
 * MCQ key across all six sub-topics, plus the eight addendum examples and
 * twenty addendum practice answers, was recomputed independently. One genuine
 * defect found:
 *
 *   - Sub-topic 05, Practice answer 4 (page 169). The question: "To a man
 *     walking east at 5 m/s, the wind appears to blow from the north at 5 m/s.
 *     Find the actual velocity of the wind." The printed answer block appears
 *     TWICE on the page in contradictory forms, one ending "(i.e. velocity
 *     5i − 5j, toward south-east)" and the other ending "−5i − 5j, toward
 *     south-west)". Only the first is right. Working: the apparent wind blows
 *     FROM the north, so it travels southward and v(wind, man) = (0, −5).
 *     Since v(wind, man) = v(wind) − v(man), v(wind) = (0, −5) + (5, 0) =
 *     (5, −5) m/s, magnitude 5√2 ≈ 7.07 m/s, pointing south-east, which is a
 *     wind blowing FROM the north-west. The south-west variant comes from
 *     subtracting the man's velocity a second time instead of adding it. This
 *     chapter's Topic 05 practice item 4 carries the corrected answer with the
 *     sign reasoning spelled out.
 *
 *   Everything else matched: all 24 worked examples, all 30 practice answers,
 *   all 24 MCQ keys, and every addendum result used below. In particular the
 *   Example 3 note that a zero-drift crossing (10 s) is slower than the
 *   minimum-time crossing (8 s), the complementary-angle sum H1 + H2 = u2/2g
 *   = 20 m, the radius of curvature 20√2 ≈ 28.3 m, the closest approach
 *   10√2 ≈ 14.1 km at t = 1 h, and the vertical-circle tensions 44 N and
 *   164 N differing by exactly 6mg = 120 N were each re-derived from scratch
 *   and agree with the print.
 *
 *   Two items that look like errors and are not, recorded so the next author
 *   does not "fix" them:
 *
 *   - Addendum B, Practice answer 4 prints a visible self-correction ("and
 *     √3 > 2 is false... check carefully"). Its final verdict, that a bead on
 *     a rigid wire launched at u = √(3gl) does NOT complete the loop because
 *     3gl < 4gl, is correct. The wandering is editorial, not arithmetic.
 *   - The Addendum's own preface says "five examinable patterns" and then
 *     prints four lettered addenda. Addendum A really does carry two distinct
 *     patterns (the tower shot and the inclined plane), so the count is honest.
 *
 * SOURCE DAMAGE. Every passage below was re-authored from context, never
 * transcribed. The patterns actually present in pages 131 to 193:
 *
 *   - NON-ASCII MATH OPERATORS DIE AS BACKSLASH TOKENS, four distinct ones,
 *     58 occurrences in this range. `\n7` is a minus sign: page 133's
 *     "|A \n7 B| <= R <= A + B" is the resultant range |A − B| ≤ R ≤ A + B;
 *     page 142's cross-product component "(AyBz \n7 AzBy)" is a subtraction;
 *     page 158's "y = (u sin t) t \n7 ½gt2" is the projectile's vertical
 *     position; page 166's rain formula "vrm = vr \n7 vm" is a vector
 *     subtraction; page 176's "T = mv2/r \n7 mg" is the top-of-loop tension.
 *     `\nA` (20 times) is the dot operator, so page 133's "A \nA B = AB cos"
 *     is A · B = AB cos θ, and page 158's range derivation "(u cos) \nA
 *     2u sin/g" is a plain multiplication. `\nN` (14 times) is the cross
 *     operator: page 133's "A \nN B = (AB sin) n" is A × B. `\nK` (4 times)
 *     is the degree sign, so page 158's "2θ = 90 \nK" is 2θ = 90° and page
 *     177's banking answer "θ ≈ 24.2 \nK" is 24.2°.
 *   - GREEK LETTERS AND ITALIC SYMBOLS VANISH WITH NO PLACEHOLDER wherever a
 *     run is set in the figure-caption face. The worst two, both reconstructed
 *     entirely from the surrounding argument rather than token by token:
 *     (a) Figure 3.1's trailing derivation on pages 133 and 134 extracts as
 *     "Drop a perpendicular from to the line extended, meeting it at . In the
 *     right triangle : = cos , = sin . Now in the right triangle , with = +
 *     = + cos : 2 = 2 + 2 = (+ cos )2 + (sin )2." Rebuilt against the intact
 *     body text on page 135 and the figure brief on the same page, this is:
 *     drop QS perpendicular to the extension of OP, meeting it at S; in right
 *     triangle PQS, PS = B cos θ and QS = B sin θ; then in right triangle OQS,
 *     with OS = OP + PS = A + B cos θ, R2 = OS2 + QS2 = (A + B cos θ)2 +
 *     (B sin θ)2, which expands to A2 + B2 + 2AB cos θ. Topic 01's `deriv`
 *     block below is that reconstruction.
 *     (b) Figure 3.6's trailing derivation on pages 174 and 175 extracts as
 *     "the length of this third side is |Δ | = Δ. The magnitude of the
 *     acceleration is therefore = lim Δ→0 |Δ | Δ= lim Δ→0 Δ Δ= . Using = to
 *     rewrite this: = = 2 = 2." Rebuilt from the intact prose on page 174 (the
 *     isosceles velocity triangle, the tangent turning by the same Δθ as the
 *     radius) this is: |Δv| = v Δθ; a(c) = lim(Δt→0) |Δv|/Δt = lim(Δt→0)
 *     v Δθ/Δt = vω; and using v = ωr, a(c) = vω = v2/r = ω2r. Topic 06's
 *     `deriv` block below is that reconstruction, and it is the only route to
 *     the chapter's headline formula, so it could not simply be dropped.
 *     The same loss hits every angle in every second-copy figure caption on
 *     pages 134, 143, 151, 159, 167, 175 and 178.
 *   - SUPERSCRIPTS AND SUBSCRIPTS LAND ON THEIR OWN LINES, which breaks every
 *     squared quantity, every unit with an exponent, and every subscripted
 *     component in the range: "m/s" then "2" on the next line for m/s2, "sin"
 *     then "2" then the angle for sin2θ, "A" then "x" for the x-component,
 *     "v" then "max" for the maximum speed. Recomputing all 24 worked examples
 *     (see above) was the check that these were reassembled correctly, since a
 *     misplaced exponent changes an answer.
 *   - INTER-WORD SPACES VANISH at tight kerning, throughout. Instances used in
 *     or adjacent to prose written below: "forallof" (p.131, "for all of"),
 *     "magnitudeanda direction" (p.131, "magnitude and a direction"),
 *     "donotsimply add" (p.132, "do not simply add"), "theeffectivecombined
 *     push" (p.132), "thedirectionis exactly what speed throws away" (p.137),
 *     "andtime-of-closest-direction" (p.148), "travels farsideways
 *     whilefalling" (p.156), "carries thewhole boat downstream" (p.164),
 *     "can't speed upor slow down" (p.170), "centripetaldynamics" and
 *     "isamarriage of two things" (p.181), "loop nearlyevery other year"
 *     (p.185), "below the available0.5" (p.188).
 *   - ONE PAGE'S ANSWER BLOCK IS REFLOWED OUT OF ORDER. Page 169's Sub-topic
 *     05 answer key is split into two runs that the extraction interleaves
 *     with the page number, so answers 1 and 2 are lost entirely and answer 4
 *     appears twice with opposite directions. Answers 1 and 2 were recomputed
 *     rather than read (40 s and 160 m; 45° from the vertical); answer 4 is
 *     the correction recorded above.
 *   - NOT OBSERVED IN THIS RANGE: the ASCII-shifted-by-29 heading run. Every
 *     printable token in pages 131 to 193 was decoded by −29 and none produced
 *     English, so this chapter's headings are intact.
 *
 * DIMENSIONS. Every formula printed below, reduced to M L T. Angles, and
 * therefore sin, cos, tan and every ratio of two like quantities, are pure
 * numbers throughout.
 *
 *   Topic 01, vectors and resolution:
 *   - Unit vector A/|A|: [X]/[X] = 1, dimensionless, as the chapter states.
 *   - Ax = A cos θ, Ay = A sin θ: both carry A's own dimension. ✓
 *   - A = √(Ax2 + Ay2): [X]. tan θ = Ay/Ax: dimensionless. ✓
 *   - R = √(A2 + B2 + 2AB cos θ): every term under the root is [X2], so R is
 *     [X]. This is also the check that the parallelogram law can only ever
 *     combine LIKE quantities: a force and a velocity have no resultant.
 *   - tan α = B sin θ/(A + B cos θ): [X]/[X] = 1. ✓
 *   - |A − B| ≤ R ≤ A + B: three quantities of the same dimension. ✓
 *
 *   Topic 02, products:
 *   - A · B = AB cos θ: [A][B]. A × B: |A||B| sin θ, also [A][B]. The two
 *     products are dimensionally IDENTICAL and differ only in rank, which is
 *     exactly why a dimension check cannot catch the cos-for-sin slip and the
 *     chapter has to teach the physics test instead.
 *   - W = F · d: [M L T−2][L] = [M L2 T−2], energy. ✓
 *   - P = F · v: [M L T−2][L T−1] = [M L2 T−3], power. ✓
 *   - τ = r × F: [L][M L T−2] = [M L2 T−2]. Same dimensions as work and a
 *     completely different quantity, flagged in Topic 02 as the standing
 *     counterexample to "same dimensions means same thing".
 *   - L = r × p: [L][M L T−1] = [M L2 T−1]. ✓
 *   - Scalar triple product of three displacements: [L3], a volume. ✓
 *
 *   Topic 03, plane kinematics:
 *   - v = dr/dt: [L T−1]. a = dv/dt: [L T−2]. ✓
 *   - |v| = √(vx2 + vy2): [L T−1]. ✓
 *   - v = v0 + at: [L T−1] = [L T−1] + [L T−2][T]. ✓
 *   - r = r0 + v0t + ½at2: [L] = [L] + [L T−1][T] + [L T−2][T2]. ✓
 *   - vx2 = v0x2 + 2ax Δx: [L2 T−2] = [L2 T−2] + [L T−2][L]. ✓
 *   - Radius of curvature r = v2/a(perp): [L2 T−2]/[L T−2] = [L]. ✓
 *
 *   Topic 04, projectiles:
 *   - T = 2u sin θ/g: [L T−1]/[L T−2] = [T]. ✓
 *   - H = u2 sin2θ/2g: [L2 T−2]/[L T−2] = [L]. ✓
 *   - R = u2 sin 2θ/g: [L]. Rmax = u2/g: [L]. ✓
 *   - y = x tan θ − gx2/(2u2cos2θ): [L] − [L T−2][L2]/[L2 T−2] = [L] − [L].
 *     ✓ This one is worth doing slowly: the second term's u2 in the
 *     denominator is what rescues it, and dropping it is a real exam error.
 *   - Horizontal launch, T = √(2h/g): √([L]/[L T−2]) = √[T2] = [T]. ✓
 *     R = u√(2h/g): [L T−1][T] = [L]. ✓
 *   - R = 4H cot θ: [L] = [L]. H1 + H2 = u2/2g: [L]. ✓
 *
 *   Topic 05, relative velocity:
 *   - vAB = vA − vB and vAg = vAb + vbg: [L T−1] throughout. ✓
 *   - t = d/vb: [L]/[L T−1] = [T]. Drift = vr d/vb: [L T−1][L]/[L T−1] = [L].
 *     ✓
 *   - sin θ = vr/vb: dimensionless, which is also why the crossing is
 *     impossible when the ratio exceeds 1. t = d/√(vb2 − vr2): [T]. ✓
 *   - tan α = vm/vr: dimensionless. ✓
 *   - Closest approach s = |r0 × v|/|v|: [L][L T−1]/[L T−1] = [L]. ✓
 *
 *   Topic 06, circular motion:
 *   - s = rθ: [L], θ being a pure number, which is the whole reason radians
 *     and not degrees.
 *   - v = ωr: [T−1][L] = [L T−1]. at = αr: [T−2][L] = [L T−2]. ✓
 *   - ω = 2π/T = 2πf: [T−1]. ✓
 *   - ac = v2/r = ω2r = vω: [L2 T−2]/[L] and [T−2][L] and [L T−1][T−1] all
 *     reduce to [L T−2]. Three forms, one dimension, which is the fastest
 *     check that they really are the same acceleration.
 *   - Fc = mv2/r = mω2r: [M L T−2]. ✓
 *   - a = √(at2 + ac2): [L T−2]. ✓
 *   - ω = ω0 + αt, θ = ω0t + ½αt2, ω2 = ω02 + 2αθ: [T−1], dimensionless,
 *     [T−2]. ✓
 *   - tan θ = v2/rg: [L2 T−2]/([L][L T−2]) = 1, dimensionless as an angle's
 *     tangent must be. ✓
 *   - vmax = √(μrg): √([L][L T−2]) = [L T−1], μ being dimensionless. ✓
 *
 *   38 formula lines checked, 38 dimensionally consistent, none informal.
 *
 * PHYSICAL PLAUSIBILITY AND LIMITING CASES. No speed anywhere approaches c
 * (the fastest number in the chapter is 43.6 m/s, an impact speed). No
 * negative time or negative distance survives any solution: the projectile
 * flight-time quadratic in Topic 04 explicitly discards its negative root, and
 * Topic 05's closest-approach work names what a negative t means physically
 * rather than silently dropping it. Limiting cases used to teach rather than
 * merely quoted:
 *   - θ → 0°, 90°, 180° in the parallelogram law, read straight off
 *     R = √(A2 + B2 + 2AB cos θ) as A + B, √(A2 + B2) and |A − B|. These are
 *     drawn as three chips of the Topic 01 range figure, so the band
 *     |A − B| ≤ R ≤ A + B is something a student has seen, not memorised.
 *   - θ → 90° for a projectile: R = u2 sin 2θ/g goes to zero, which is the
 *     answer to "why isn't steeper always farther", used as an MCQ nudge.
 *   - θ → 0° for a projectile: both R and H vanish. Together with the above,
 *     the maximum at 45° is bracketed rather than asserted.
 *   - α → 0 collapses the angular equations to θ = ωt, i.e. uniform circular
 *     motion, named in Topic 06's snapshot.
 *   - μ → 0 on a banked road collapses the safe-speed band to the single
 *     design speed √(rg tan θ), and θ → 0 collapses it to the flat-road
 *     √(μrg). Both appear in Topic 06's `protip`, drawn from Addendum C's own
 *     consistency checks.
 *   - vb → vr in the river problem: the minimum-drift heading goes to 90°,
 *     the drift goes to zero and the crossing time goes to infinity. Topic
 *     05's `protip` uses this, from Addendum D, as the case where two correct
 *     limits genuinely disagree.
 *
 * SEAMS: what is quoted as already known and never re-derived here, all from
 * math-11-03-trigonometry.ts, the Class 11 maths prerequisite.
 *   - sin, cos and tan as the coordinates of a point on the unit circle (that
 *     file's Topic 02). Resolution in Topic 01 below is named as exactly that
 *     identification, in one `think` block, rather than re-taught.
 *   - sin2θ + cos2θ = 1 (that file's Topic 02 snapshot). Used without comment
 *     wherever components reassemble into a magnitude, and it is the single
 *     step that finishes the parallelogram-law derivation in Topic 01 and the
 *     complementary-height result in Topic 04.
 *   - The standard values sin 30° = 1/2, cos 30° = √3/2, sin 45° = cos 45° =
 *     1/√2, sin 60° = √3/2 (that file's Topic 03). Used numerically
 *     throughout and never listed.
 *   - The allied-angle rule sin(180° − θ) = sin θ (that file's Topic 03
 *     snapshot). This is the whole proof that complementary launch angles
 *     share a range, and Topic 04 cites it by name in one line instead of
 *     proving it.
 *   - sin 2A = 2 sin A cos A (that file's Topic 05). This is the only step
 *     between R = 2u2 sin θ cos θ/g and R = u2 sin 2θ/g, and Topic 04's
 *     `deriv` names it as a quotation.
 *   - Radian measure and s = rθ (that file's Topic 01). Topic 06 uses it as
 *     the definition it already is, and differentiates it; it does not
 *     re-establish why an angle in radians is a pure number.
 *   NOT quoted, deliberately: math-12-10-vector-algebra.ts. That is a Class 12
 *   chapter, so a Class 11 physics student has not met it, and every vector
 *   idea this chapter needs (components, the parallelogram law, the two
 *   products, the determinant form, the triple products) is therefore built
 *   here from scratch in Topics 01 and 02 rather than assumed.
 *
 * FIGURES. Eleven `diagram` blocks, all of kind `plot`, carrying eighteen
 * frames between them. All seven figures the source names are drawn: 3.1
 * (Topic 01), 3.2 (Topic 02), 3.3 (Topic 03), 3.4 (Topic 04), 3.5 (Topic 05),
 * 3.6 and 3.7 (Topic 06). Four more were designed where the text plainly needs
 * a picture the source never asks for: the resolution-and-range chart in Topic
 * 01, the dropped-versus-fired independence pair in Topic 03, the rain-man
 * pair in Topic 05, and the two-accelerations pair in Topic 06. None dropped,
 * and no new figure vocabulary requested.
 *
 * THE PANEL RULE, applied. The source describes 3.2, 3.5 and 3.6 as "two
 * side-by-side panels". Each is one diagram block with two chips, never two
 * panels inside one frame: at 316pt a half-frame is 150pt and unreadable, and
 * comparing by tapping beats squinting. The same treatment gives the Topic 01
 * range chart four chips and the three designed pairs two chips each.
 *
 * FIVE FIELDS THE READER DOES NOT RUN THROUGH `Markup`, which the next author
 * should know before writing a subscript. Read off components/textbook: a
 * `deriv` step's `why` (blocks.tsx line 200), a `snapshot` row's `note` (408)
 * and its `aids` (410), a `def`'s `term` (126), and a diagram's `chips` and
 * `captions` (diagrams.tsx 273 and 283) are all plain `<Text>`. Every other
 * text field goes through `Markup`. So a `<sub>` or a `<sup>` in one of those
 * five reaches the student as five literal characters, and so does an
 * underscore standing in for a subscript. Auditing the whole corpus found 103
 * such instances across eight chapters, including eight in the finished pilot
 * (phy-11-02, e.g. the third `why` of its equations-of-motion derivation ends
 * "turns the triangle into ½at<sup>2</sup>", which a student reads verbatim).
 * Nothing in this file is one: every one of those five fields here is written
 * as plain prose, with the figure's own arrow labels reused in the captions
 * (vb, vr, ac, at) rather than a subscript that cannot render. That is also
 * why some captions read "the vertical part has been spent" where a marked-up
 * field would have said v with a subscript y.
 *
 * DIAGRAM FRAMES ARE NOT ISOMETRIC, which matters for every angle mark. The
 * renderer scales x and y independently to fill the frame, so an arc whose
 * `from`/`to` are computed from plot coordinates lands somewhere else on
 * screen. Every arc below was computed in SCREEN degrees from the frame's own
 * two scale factors, not from the plot-unit slope: the Topic 01 resolution
 * chip reads 28° rather than the 35° its components suggest, Figure 3.2's two
 * angles read 39° and 53°, Figure 3.4's launch reads 61°, and Figure 3.5's
 * upstream heading reads 107°. For the same reason Figure 3.7's normal force
 * is specified as a screen-perpendicular to the drawn road surface, which is
 * NOT the plot-unit perpendicular; drawing the latter tilts N by ten degrees
 * and quietly breaks the figure the whole banking derivation rests on.

CBSE Boards ask the parallelogram-law derivation for 2 to 3 marks, plus a component-resolution numerical. JEE Main reliably carries one or two questions on resultants, unit vectors, or the range of a resultant. NEET tests fast conceptual MCQs, scalar versus vector, the resultant range, perpendicularity. JEE Advanced folds vector algebra silently into mechanics and electromagnetism, so fluency here pays off across the whole syllabus.<br><br><b>02 · Vector Products, Dot and Cross</b><br>Vector multiplication resurfaces across mechanics, electromagnetism and modern physics. CBSE Boards ask the definitions, the properties, and a work-done numerical. JEE Main reliably carries a question on the angle between two vectors, a projection, an area, or the determinant form of the cross product. NEET tests quick conceptual MCQs: which quantity is a dot product, which is a cross product, what makes two vectors perpendicular. JEE Advanced exploits the scalar and vector triple products and hides these operations inside torque, angular momentum and Biot-Savart problems.<br><br><b>03 · Two-Dimensional Kinematics</b><br>This is the general framework that projectile and circular motion are special cases of. CBSE Boards ask the vector form of the equations of motion and position or velocity in component form, 2 to 3 marks. JEE Main carries questions on constant-acceleration motion in a plane, velocity and position vectors, and the shape of a trajectory. NEET tests the independence-of-motions idea and quick component-magnitude MCQs. JEE Advanced uses it for radius-of-curvature and closest-direction problems.<br><br><b>04 · Projectile Motion</b><br>One of the single most-tested topics in all of Class 11 mechanics. CBSE Boards reliably ask a derivation, time of flight, range or maximum height, plus a numerical. JEE Main carries one to two questions every year: trajectory, range and height relations, velocity at an instant, or a horizontal projectile launched from a height. NEET loves the conceptual traps, velocity and acceleration at the top, complementary angles. JEE Advanced layers it with inclined planes, radius of curvature and target-hitting constraints.<br><br><b>05 · Relative Velocity in Two Dimensions</b><br>A classic and heavily tested application of vectors. CBSE Boards ask the river-boat crossing, time and drift, and the rain-umbrella problem, 2 to 4 marks. JEE Main reliably carries one question: shortest path across a river, minimum time, or the relative velocity of two moving bodies. NEET tests the rain-man angle and a basic crossing. JEE Advanced layers it with closest-approach problems and currents stronger than the boat's own speed.<br><br><b>06 · Circular Motion Dynamics</b><br>A rich, high-yield topic that also seeds Rotational Motion and Gravitation later. CBSE Boards ask the centripetal-acceleration derivation and the definitions of the angular quantities, 2 to 3 marks. JEE Main reliably carries a question on centripetal force, angular kinematics, or banking. NEET tests the conceptual core hard: the direction of the acceleration, constant speed yet accelerating, the centrifugal-force misconception.
