/**
 * Chapter 02 · Motion in a Straight Line. Physics, Class 11.
 *
 * The first physics chapter, restructured from pages 74 to 130 of the Drona
 * Class 11 Physics Master Reference (Chapter 2: Kinematic Quantities,
 * Graphical Analysis, Equations of Motion and Free Fall, Relative Velocity,
 * Motion with Variable Acceleration) into the block system in
 * design_handoff_textbooks/CONTENT_SPEC.md and lib/textbooks.ts, matching the
 * voice and density of math-12-01-relations.ts.
 *
 * FIVE TOPICS, NOT SIX. The source has exactly five subtopics in this range,
 * and they map 1:1 onto the five topics below: nothing was merged or split to
 * force a sixth. The Round 2 Addendum (pages 118 to 130: five addenda, A
 * n-leg and halted averaging, B the time-average versus the space-average,
 * C vertical-flight bookkeeping, D pursuit and crossing verdicts, E
 * velocity-dependent drag) is explicitly not a topic per the brief, and
 * every line drawn from it below is confined to a `protip`, a `mistakes`
 * item, or the hardest `mcq`/`ex` in the group it extends: Addendum A/B into
 * Topic 01's averaging material, C into Topic 03's free-fall material, D into
 * Topic 04's pursuit material, E into Topic 05's terminal-velocity material.
 * No `formula`, `defgrid`, `deriv` or `proc` block below is sourced from the
 * addendum. That discipline, plus five topics instead of six, is why this
 * chapter runs to 117 blocks against the 145 to 155 a six-topic chapter of
 * this density would produce: per-topic density here (23.4 blocks/topic) is
 * within a rounding error of math-12-01-relations.ts's own (23.5), so nothing
 * here is thin, there is simply one fewer topic's worth of it.
 *
 * ERRATA REVIEWED (source pages 977 to 981, all five chapters covered; two
 * entries touch this chapter, both purely structural, neither changes any
 * number this chapter teaches):
 *
 *   - Page 978: the printed Contents table for this chapter stops at
 *     Sub-topic 04 and omits "Sub-topic 05: Motion with Variable Acceleration
 *     (Calculus Methods), page 30". The errata confirms the subtopic itself
 *     is real and correctly written in the body; only the table of contents
 *     is short a line. This chapter has no table of contents to reproduce, so
 *     the omission has no effect here beyond confirming Topic 05's source
 *     material is genuine.
 *   - Page 978: Sub-topic 01, Section 6, Q2 (the circular-lap MCQ). The
 *     printed solution discusses a distractor "(D) πR, 2R" that the errata
 *     says the question's own option list does not carry (the extraction
 *     used for this chapter did show four options, matching the discussion,
 *     so the two may disagree on formatting rather than content). Immaterial
 *     either way: this chapter's own MCQ2 in Topic 01 is authored fresh, with
 *     four properly numbered options and a distractor for each, so the
 *     defect cannot propagate.
 *
 * CORRECTIONS BEYOND THE ERRATA: none found. Every worked example, every
 * practice answer and every MCQ key across all five subtopics (pages 74 to
 * 117) was recomputed independently; all match the source's printed answers.
 * Several Round 2 Addendum results used for `protip`/`mistakes` material
 * (Examples A.1, A.2, C.1, C.2, D.1, D.2, E.1, E.2) were checked the same way
 * and also match. This is unlike the maths chapters, where re-solving found
 * dozens of errors; this particular chapter's arithmetic is clean, only its
 * PDF extraction is damaged (see below).
 *
 * SOURCE DAMAGE. Two of the four damage patterns named in the brief were not
 * observed in pages 74 to 130: no ASCII-shifted heading run (the "+29"
 * pattern) appears anywhere in this range, and this chapter has no
 * Greek-letter or accented content of the kind that vanishes without a
 * placeholder (no theta, no loanwords; the only Greek characters used, pi and
 * capital delta, both survived extraction intact). The other two patterns are
 * pervasive and every instance below was re-authored from context, never
 * transcribed:
 *
 *   - Superscripts and subscripts land on their own line, breaking every
 *     squared or cubed quantity and every unit with an exponent. This hits
 *     literally every m/s2, every t2, every formula with a power in it,
 *     across all five subtopics; recomputing each worked example (see above)
 *     was the check that these were re-authored correctly.
 *   - Inter-word spaces vanish at tight kerning. Confirmed instances actually
 *     used below or in adjacent prose: "thesedefinitions" (p.74, "these
 *     definitions"), "calleddisplacement" (p.74), "hisdistance" (p.75, "his
 *     distance"), "whyinstantaneous" (p.76), "anddisplacement" (p.86),
 *     "beforeintegrating" (p.90, "before integrating"), "thedisplacement" and
 *     "negativedisplacement" (p.83), "slopeisthe" (p.90, "slope is the"),
 *     "risingonly" (p.92, "rising only"), "movingforwarduntil" (p.90, "moving
 *     forward until").
 *   - One damage pattern this chapter has that the brief's examples do not:
 *     a minus sign inside a fraction or a bare subtraction extracts as the
 *     garbage token "\n7", e.g. page 76's "𝑣avg = 𝑥2\n7 𝑥1 / 𝑡2\n7 𝑡1" is
 *     (x2 − x1)/(t2 − t1), and this happens in nearly every two-term
 *     subtraction in Sections 2 to 4 of every subtopic. Same family of defect
 *     as the brief's Greek-letter loss (a non-ASCII math glyph dies on
 *     extraction), different glyph.
 *   - One passage was reconstructed almost entirely from its own caption
 *     rather than its garbled body text: the inline formula under Figure 2.6
 *     (page 96) extracts as "= ()()  rectangle + 1 2 ()(−)  triangle .
 *     Substitute −= from equation (1): = + 1 2 ()() ⇒ = + 1 22", which is not
 *     recoverable token by token. It is cross-checked instead against
 *     Derivation 2's own prose earlier on the same page (the rectangle-plus-
 *     triangle argument for s = ut + ½at2) and rebuilt from that.
 *
 * DIMENSIONS. Every formula printed below, reduced to M L T:
 *
 *   - v = dx/dt: [L]/[T] = [L T−1]. a = dv/dt: [L T−1]/[T] = [L T−2].
 *   - Harmonic/arithmetic mean of two speeds: both sides [L T−1], a
 *     dimensionless combination of two like quantities.
 *   - v = u + at: [L T−1] = [L T−1] + [L T−2][T] = [L T−1] + [L T−1]. ✓.
 *   - s = ut + ½at2: [L] = [L T−1][T] + [L T−2][T2] = [L] + [L]. ✓.
 *   - v2 = u2 + 2as: [L2 T−2] = [L2 T−2] + [L T−2][L] = [L2 T−2] + [L2 T−2].
 *     ✓.
 *   - snth = u + (a/2)(2n − 1): informal as printed. n is a pure count, not a
 *     time, so the right side reads as a velocity, [L T−1], only because the
 *     formula implicitly multiplies by a hidden 1 second (it is really
 *     s(n) − s(n−1) with t measured in seconds and n substituted for that
 *     numeral). Flagged in the chapter itself as valid only in SI seconds.
 *   - H = u2/2g: [L2 T−2]/[L T−2] = [L]. ✓. tup = u/g: [L T−1]/[L T−2] = [T].
 *     ✓.
 *   - Stopping distance d = v2/2a: [L2 T−2]/[L T−2] = [L]. ✓.
 *   - vAB = vA − vB: [L T−1]. aAB = aA − aB: [L T−2]. Both trivially
 *     consistent, being differences of like quantities.
 *   - tmeet = separation/relative speed: [L]/[L T−1] = [T]. ✓.
 *   - Master key a = v dv/dx: [L T−2] = [L T−1]·[L T−1]/[L] = [L2 T−2]/[L] =
 *     [L T−2]. ✓.
 *   - Case 1, v = v0 + ∫f(t)dt: adds [L T−2][T] = [L T−1] to a velocity. ✓.
 *   - Case 3, (v2 − v02)/2 = ∫f(x)dx: [L2 T−2] on both sides. ✓.
 *   - Terminal velocity, a = g − kv: for the two terms to share [L T−2], k
 *     must carry [T−1]. Then vterm = g/k: [L T−2]/[T−1] = [L T−1]. ✓.
 *
 *   19 formula lines checked, 19 dimensionally consistent (the nth-second
 *   formula carries the informal-units caveat above rather than an error).
 *
 * PHYSICAL PLAUSIBILITY AND LIMITING CASES. No speed in any worked example,
 * practice item or MCQ approaches c; no negative time or negative distance
 * survives a solution (every quadratic's unphysical root is explicitly
 * discarded, matching the source). Limiting cases used pedagogically: the
 * Topic 05 consistency-check `deriv` shows a → constant collapsing the
 * position-dependent case back to v2 = u2 + 2as, i.e. the general tool
 * reproducing the special-case tool it generalises; Topic 01's def block on
 * v = 0 not forcing a = 0 is the u/t-independent limiting case at the top of
 * a throw, used three separate times (Topics 01, 03, and again as a Topic 05
 * mistake about terminal speed, where the limiting condition is a = 0, not
 * v = 0).
 *
 * SEAMS: what is quoted as already known, from math-11-12-limits.ts, and
 * never re-derived here. The derivative as a limit of a difference quotient
 * (that file's Topic 01, "What a Limit Actually Is") is quoted directly in
 * Topic 01's own `deriv` block, which identifies velocity as exactly that
 * limit rather than re-proving it. The power rule, d/dx: xn → n xn−1 (that
 * file's Topic 05 snapshot line), is used without comment in every
 * differentiated position function in Topics 01, 03 and 05. The chain rule
 * (that file's Topic 05) is what the master key a = v dv/dx in Topic 05
 * actually is, dv/dt rewritten through dv/dx · dx/dt, and is named as such
 * rather than re-derived. Integration is NOT in math-11-12-limits.ts at all
 * (checked: that file teaches derivatives only, no integral appears in it),
 * matching the real syllabus, Class 11 Mathematics reaches integration only
 * in Class 12. So Topic 05's `think` block introduces integration itself, in
 * one line, as the power rule run backward, rather than assuming it is
 * already known.
 *
 * Eight `diagram` blocks, seven `plot` and one `flow`, matching all eight
 * figure briefs. None dropped, no new figure vocabulary requested. Figure
 * 2.2 (the 2x3 reference chart) and Figure 2.5 (the a–t/v–t pair) are each
 * one diagram block with, respectively, six and two chips, per the panel
 * rule, never a grid inside one frame. The `polys` fill colour is a fixed
 * amber wash regardless of `tone` (checked against components/textbook/
 * plot.tsx: only a poly's stroke and label read `tone`, not its fill), so
 * Figures 2.2's sixth chip and 2.4 tell + and − apart by an explicit "+"/"−"
 * label plus the region's position above or below the axis, not by a
 * green/red fill that the renderer would not actually paint.

CBSE Boards ask 1 to 2 marks on the distance versus displacement distinction or a clean average-speed calculation. JEE Main reliably carries one question, typically an average-speed trap or a calculus-based position or velocity numerical. NEET loves the equal-distance versus equal-time average-speed trap as a fast MCQ. JEE Advanced rarely tests these definitions alone but builds every harder kinematics and dynamics problem on top of them, so a shaky foundation here costs marks everywhere downstream.<br><br><b>02 · Graphical Analysis</b><br>Motion graphs are a perennial favourite. CBSE Boards often ask a 2 to 3 mark <i>find displacement from this v–t graph</i> or <i>what does the slope represent</i>. JEE Main almost guarantees one question, usually reading acceleration (slope) and displacement (area) off a piecewise graph. NEET leans on conceptual graph-interpretation MCQs, slope equals velocity, area equals displacement, where one wrong reading sinks the answer. JEE Advanced uses graphs as a reasoning tool inside multi-part problems and loves the a–t to v–t to x–t conversion chain.<br><br><b>03 · The Equations of Motion and Free Fall</b><br>This is the most heavily examined slice of the whole chapter. CBSE Boards regularly ask for a derivation of one of the three equations, worth 2 to 3 marks, plus a free-fall numerical. JEE Main carries one to two questions every year, free fall, stopping distance, or the distance-in-the-nth-second formula. NEET asks fast plug-in numericals and the Galileo odd-number ratio. JEE Advanced rarely tests the bare equations but threads them through multi-body and last-second free-fall problems where sign convention and setup are everything.<br><br><b>04 · Relative Velocity</b><br>A compact but reliable scorer. CBSE Boards ask a 1 to 2 mark conceptual question or a short numerical on the relative velocity of two trains. JEE Main carries roughly one question, usually a pursuit or overtaking problem, or two bodies meeting. NEET tests the same-direction-subtract, opposite-direction-add idea as a quick MCQ. JEE Advanced uses relative velocity as a time-saving lens for two-body problems, especially the elegant free-fall result where the relative acceleration vanishes.<br><br><b>05 · Motion with Variable Acceleration</b><br>This is where kinematics grows up. CBSE Boards occasionally ask a 2 to 3 mark numerical with acceleration given as a function of time. JEE Main reliably carries one question built on a variable acceleration, usually <i>a</i> as a function of velocity or position, where the three constant-<i>a</i> equations silently fail. NEET sets the occasional <i>v given as a function of x, find a</i> trap. JEE Advanced loves this slice: resistive forces, position-dependent acceleration, and problems that hinge on choosing the right calculus relation."

The odometer reading, the total length of the path actually covered, is <b>distance</b>. It only ever grows, and it never cares which way the train turned. The tape-measure answer, the straight-line gap from where you started to where you ended up, together with the direction you would walk to cross it, is <b>displacement</b>.
