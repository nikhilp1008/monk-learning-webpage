/**
 * Chapter 09 · Straight Lines. Mathematics, Class 11.
 *
 * Restructured from pages 684 to 779 of the Drona Class 11 Mathematics Master
 * Reference into the block system in design_handoff_textbooks/CONTENT_SPEC.md,
 * following math-11-01-sets.ts and math-11-03-trigonometry.ts for voice and
 * density.
 *
 * The source is three documents stacked: a typeset chapter of seven subtopics
 * (00 to 06), a Round 1 supplement (subtopic 07, triangle centres, plus four
 * lettered problem patterns) and a Round 2 addendum (patterns 5 and 6 plus
 * subtopic 08, pair of straight lines). Six topics is the schema's ceiling, so
 * the supplementary material is folded into the topic it actually belongs to
 * rather than given topics of its own:
 *
 *   - Pattern 4 (shifting the origin inside an equation) and Pattern 5 (locus
 *     by introducing and eliminating a parameter) sit inside Topic 01, which is
 *     where the source's own translation and locus machinery lives.
 *   - Pattern 1 Case A (the triangle a line cuts off with the axes) sits inside
 *     Topic 03, since it is read straight off the intercepts.
 *   - Pattern 3 (the side test and the ratio in which a line divides a segment)
 *     sits inside Topic 04 next to the signed distance it is built from, and
 *     subtopic 05 (angle bisectors) joins it there: a bisector is the locus of
 *     points equidistant from two lines, which is the distance formula with the
 *     moduli removed.
 *   - Pattern 1 Case B (area from three lines), Pattern 2 (the fixed point of a
 *     one-parameter family) and subtopic 07 (triangle centres) sit inside Topic
 *     05. The supplement says outright that every triangle centre is a
 *     concurrency statement, so concurrency is its home.
 *   - Pattern 6 (the substitution map and the parallel mirror) sits inside
 *     Topic 06, which it extends and partly corrects.
 *
 * One deliberate omission. Subtopic 08, pair of straight lines, is dropped. The
 * source itself labels it optional for a Boards-only reader, says it appears
 * nowhere in NCERT Class 11 Chapter 9 and that CBSE does not set it, and it
 * carries its own machinery (the 3 × 3 degeneracy determinant, homogenisation,
 * the bisector pair in coefficient form) that would need a topic of its own.
 * Carrying it would thin all six core topics to fit.
 *
 * Three corrections to the source, all arithmetic, all verified here:
 *
 *   1. Subtopic 00, Practice 5. The locus of a point equidistant from A(3, 2)
 *      and B(−1, 4) is 2x − y + 1 = 0, not 2x − y − 1 = 0. The midpoint of AB
 *      is (1, 3), which the printed answer does not satisfy.
 *   2. Subtopic 01, Practice 3. The line through (p, 4) and (2, −3) is parallel
 *      to the line through (0, 0) and (7, 14), slope 2, when p = 11/2, not
 *      p = −3.
 *   3. Subtopic 05, Practice 3. For 3x − 4y + 1 = 0 and 12x + 5y − 2 = 0 the
 *      second constant is negative and must be flipped first, after which
 *      a₁a₂ + b₁b₂ = −36 + 20 = −16 < 0, so the origin lies in the ACUTE angle,
 *      not the obtuse one. Checked independently against the bisector slopes.
 *
 * The exam hook is authored once, on topic 1, with a bold heading per topic,
 * because the reader renders `hook` only there. Same convention, and the same
 * reason, as the Sets and Trigonometry chapters.
 *
 * Eight `diagram` blocks, all of kind `plot`, which is the figure this chapter
 * was waiting for: `line` and `vline` curves, `points` for intercepts and
 * junctions, dashed `segments` for perpendicular drops and construction lines,
 * and a staircase of `bands` for the half-plane a sign test picks out. Diagram
 * chips and captions render as plain text, not markup, so they carry no inline
 * tags.

          "html": "<b>01 · Points, Sections and Locus</b><br>The load-bearing prerequisites for the whole chapter, and every later result quietly uses them. CBSE asks the section formula, the midpoint and the area of a triangle directly, 2–3 marks. JEE Main reliably carries one question on area, collinearity or the centroid. JEE Advanced uses the <b>locus method</b> and <b>translation of axes</b> as setup machinery inside harder problems, and JEE Main names “locus and its equation” as its own syllabus line item. Master these cold and the rest of Straight Lines becomes bookkeeping.<br><br><b>02 · Slope, Inclination and the Angle Between Two Lines</b><br>Slope is the single most-used idea in all of coordinate geometry, so it turns up everywhere. CBSE Class 11 finals lean on the inclination–slope link and the parallel and perpendicular conditions for 2–4 marks. JEE Main almost always has a question riding on the angle-between-lines formula or on a collinearity or perpendicularity condition. JEE Advanced folds slope into locus and multi-line problems where <b>the vertical-line edge case is the whole trap</b>.<br><br><b>03 · Writing the Equation of a Line</b><br>The engine room: every later result rides on writing a line's equation correctly. CBSE reliably asks 2–4 marks on point-slope, intercept form, or “reduce to a given form”. JEE Main almost guarantees a question on extracting the slope and intercepts from <i>Ax</i> + <i>By</i> + <i>C</i> = 0, or on the normal form. JEE Advanced rarely tests a form in isolation but uses these as the substrate for locus, family-of-lines and triangle problems, and <b>quietly punishes the sign errors that creep into the normal form</b>.<br><br><b>04 · Distance, Side and Angle Bisectors</b><br>A perennial favourite because it is short to ask and easy to trap. CBSE carries a 2–3 mark direct distance computation almost every year. JEE Main reliably has one question on the distance of a point from a line or between two parallel lines, <b>usually with a normalisation trap baked in</b>. JEE Advanced uses the symmetric form to reach intersection points and to set up loci. Bisectors are rare on CBSE but a reliable JEE topic, and the examined skill is never writing the two equations, it is <b>identifying which is which</b>.<br><br><b>05 · Intersection, Concurrency and Triangle Centres</b><br>A JEE staple. CBSE may ask the intersection point or a simple concurrency check for 3–4 marks. JEE Main almost always carries a concurrency or family-of-lines question, and JEE Advanced loves <i>L</i><sub>1</sub> + λ<i>L</i><sub>2</sub> = 0, which writes a line through an intersection <b>without ever finding the intersection</b>. Triangle centres are a named block in both JEE syllabi: Main lists the centroid, orthocentre and circumcentre, Advanced adds the incentre, and CBSE sets 3–4 mark circumcentre and missing-vertex problems.<br><br><b>06 · Foot of Perpendicular, Image and Reflection</b><br>A high-frequency JEE topic and a CBSE favourite for 3–4 mark “find the image of the point” problems. JEE Main tests the image and foot formulas directly. JEE Advanced embeds them in reflection-of-a-line, shortest-path and optics-style problems. The reflection-in-<i>y</i> = <i>x</i> shortcut also appears constantly in functions and inverse-function questions, so it pays off well beyond this chapter."
